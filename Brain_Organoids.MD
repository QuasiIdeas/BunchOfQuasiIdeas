# The idea of â€‹â€‹brain like organoids.
Over the past decade, the science of studying the brain has advanced quite a lot.
We have managed to make a complete map of the C elegans worm.
Although the plans were much more serious. Initially, the idea was to map the brain of a rat and, moreover, to simulate it in real life.
time on an ordinary Turing machine aka supercomputer.
The idea of â€‹â€‹organoids is that we strengthen the biological organism by connecting it to the Internet
, but not directly, but by connecting to one of the organoids. Specially grown mini-brains consisting of the host's DNA
and possibly other compatible inserts As people say, two heads are good, but 2.5 is better.. The Homo sapiens brain is too large and complex to be able to make a direct interface.
It is much easier to connect to a mini-brain that is grown somewhere else in the body, such as in the stomach, if the person is fat enough.
Before this operation, it is necessary to make sure that there is no high-level consciousness in the mini-brain.
Otherwise, a number of unpleasant ethical problems will arise.
Organoids can be grown using neural cells grown in vitro and planted on a special frame printed on a 3D printer, depending on the localization in the body. I am not suggesting in this document to kill human fetuses, nothing that meets the ethical precepts, I am not suggesting
Brain-like organoids can solve scientific production problem to solve the problems of mass production, cities, infrastructure, overcoming human extinction.
Each problem has its own unique mini brain.  
They must be compatible and interchangeable and work like Lego bricks as universal computer components. 
Or like general purpouse software modules of python.
Be robust to radiation and memory confibulations

# CRISPR technology
Another way that CRISPR technology could be used to develop brain transducers is to create actuators that can stimulate neurons. These actuators could be made by inserting CRISPR-Cas9 genes into cells that are located near neurons. The CRISPR-Cas9 genes would then be used to create proteins that can stimulate neurons to fire. The use of CRISPR technology for the development of brain transducers is still in its early stages of research. However, the potential benefits of this technology are significant. CRISPR technology could be used to develop brain transducers that are more sensitive and accurate than current technologies. Additionally, CRISPR technology could be used to develop brain transducers that are more specific, meaning that they could be used to target specific neurons or neural circuits.
