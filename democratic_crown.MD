# Device for monitoring the level of democracy of the leader in a hypotetical democratic state
Includes elements of direct democracy

Requirement: Provide control over the level of democracy in the form of a display on the "crown"

* The level of democracy is determined by how much the leader undermines trust in democratic institutions.
* The level of democracy is determined by direct voting on the Internet.
* The level of democracy can also be determined taking into account the research of international experts.

The crown has an indicator with a scale from "most democratic" to "absolute dictator".
Can be combined with a brain chip.
As an extreme measure, it can contain electric shock, but in the most cases cause some temporary nervous system disorders.
Such as apathy, lack of interest in life. That is, the more democratic the leader is, the more pleasure he gets from life.

Questions:
1. How to ensure access control and protection of the device from hacking?
2. Is it necessary to change the constitution to make wearing a "crown" mandatory?
3. How to ensure that voting results cannot be falsified?
4. How to avoid potential risk from the AGI that could replace the data flow representing the real will of the people with a fake one.
