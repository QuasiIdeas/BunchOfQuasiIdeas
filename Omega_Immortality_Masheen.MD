# Omega time masheen
According to Murphy's Law, there are a million ways to do something wrong and only one way to do it right. In terms of an entire civilization, it can refer to the possible existential risks that grow with the advent of new technologies. I've written about this in more detail in these articles [Time capsule project](https://github.com/Quasikot/BunchOfQuasiIdeas/blob/main/Time%20capsule%20project.md). Here I want to talk about the technology of time control or control of the fate of our civilization. It is based on studies of UAP and the ability to travel through time, which is not prohibited by the theory of general relativity
In fact, such a machine controls reality in the present from the future. Over the course of a thousand years, it will accumulate a huge amount of data about everything on Earth. Imagine what wisdom and knowledge about life you would accumulate if you lived not 75 years, but more than 1000. Omega has great wisdom. It's something like a mind distributed in 4D space. And this machine was already trained at the development stage to operate with many arrows of time. Our minds are evolutionarily adapted to only one measure of time.
This machine can be created by our descendants and used by special intelligence services that will operate in 4D space. The question of Omega's location in 4d coordinates is also very difficult. We can consider a variant of the future when two Omegas operate in the world at once with opposite goals.
Here is diagram of how Omega can influence th destiny of one particular VIP person.

## A Potential Solution from the Physics Side
I was very interested in antigravity propulsion systems and Brown's work on electrogravity. I am sure that we do not need rockets, this is really the technology that will lead to space exploration. A potential solution for creating a low-energy warp drive was proposed by Jack Sarfatti in his work [6].
I'm not an expert in theoretical physics, so all questions about how to implement the device should be directed to him.
Here I will just give some screenshots from his presentations.

"The new cortical implants, adapted from neural-implant VR apparatus, were the final expression of WormCam technology: a small squeezed-vacuum wormhole generator, together with neural sensor apparatus, buried deep in the cortex of the recipient. The generator was laced with neurotropic chemicals so that, over several months, the recipient’s neurons would grow pathways into the generator. And the neural sensor was a highly sensitive neuron activity pattern analyzer, capable of pinpointing individual neuronal synapses.
Such an implant could read and write to a brain, and link it to others. By a conscious effort of will, an implant recipient could establish a WormCam connection from the center of her own mind to any other recipient’s.
Armed with the implants, a new linked community was emerging from the Arenas and the truth squads and other swirling maelstroms of thought and discussion that had come to characterize the new, young, worldwide polity. Brains joined to brains. Minds linked."

“There was a Jesuit called Teilhard de Chardin. He believed that just as life had covered the Earth to form the biosphere, so mankind—thinking life—would eventually encompass life to form a higher layer, a cogitative layer he called the noosphere. He argued that the rough organization of the noosphere would grow, until it cohered into a single supersapient being he called the Omega Point.”

"A WormCam essentially enables us to locate a remote camera (in technical terms a “viewpoint”) anywhere, without the need for physical intervention. WormCam intelligence—“wormint,” as the insiders are already calling it—is proving so valuable that WormCam posts have been set up to monitor most of the world’s political leaders, friendly and otherwise, the leaders of sundry religious and fanatic groups, many of the world’s larger corporations, and so on.
WormCam technology is intimate and personal. We can watch an opponent in the most private of acts, if necessary. The potential for exposure of illicit activities, even blackmail if we choose, is obvious. But more important is the picture we are now able to build up of an enemy’s intentions. The WormCam gives us information on an opponent’s contacts—for instance weapons suppliers—and we can assess knowledge factors like his religious views, culture, level of education and training, his sources of information, the media outlets he uses."
