# Omega time masheen
According to Murphy's Law, there are a million ways to do something wrong and only one way to do it right. In terms of an entire civilization, it can refer to the possible existential risks that grow with the advent of new technologies. I've written about this in more detail in these articles [Time capsule project](https://github.com/Quasikot/BunchOfQuasiIdeas/blob/main/Time%20capsule%20project.md). Here I want to talk about the technology of time control or control of the fate of our civilization. It is based on studies of UAP and the ability to travel through time, which is not prohibited by the theory of general relativity
In fact, such a machine controls reality in the present from the future. Over the course of a thousand years, it will accumulate a huge amount of data about everything on Earth. Imagine what wisdom and knowledge about life you would accumulate if you lived not 75 years, but more than 1000. Omega has great wisdom. It's something like a mind distributed in 4D space. And this machine was already trained at the development stage to operate with many arrows of time. Our minds are evolutionarily adapted to only one measure of time.
This machine can be created by our descendants and used by special intelligence services that will operate in 4D space. The question of Omega's location in 4d coordinates is also very difficult. We can consider a variant of the future when two Omegas operate in the world at once with opposite goals.
Here is diagram of how Omega can influence th destiny of one particular VIP person.

## A Potential Solution from the Physics Side
I was very interested in antigravity propulsion systems and Brown's work on electrogravity. I am sure that we do not need rockets, this is really the technology that will lead to space exploration. A potential solution for creating a low-energy warp drive was proposed by Jack Sarfatti in his work [6].
I'm not an expert in theoretical physics, so all questions about how to implement the device should be directed to him.
Here I will just give some screenshots from his presentations.
