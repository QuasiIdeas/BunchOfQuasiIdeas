# Omega time masheen

According to Murphy's Law, there are a million ways to do something wrong and only one way to do it right. In terms of an entire civilization, it can refer to the possible existential risks that grow with the advent of new technologies. I've written about this in more detail in these articles [Time capsule project](https://github.com/Quasikot/BunchOfQuasiIdeas/blob/main/Time%20capsule%20project.md). Here I want to talk about the technology of time control or control of the fate of our civilization. It is based on studies of UAP and the ability to travel through time, which is not prohibited by the theory of general relativity
In fact, such a machine controls reality in the present from the future. Over the course of a thousand years, it will accumulate a huge amount of data about everything on Earth. Imagine what wisdom and knowledge about life you would accumulate if you lived not 75 years, but more than 1000. Omega has great wisdom. It's something like a mind distributed in 4D space. And this machine was already trained at the development stage to operate with many arrows of time. Our minds are evolutionarily adapted to only one measure of time.
This machine can be created by our descendants and used by special intelligence services that will operate in 4D space. The question of Omega's location in 4d coordinates is also very difficult. We can consider a variant of the future when two Omegas operate in the world at once with opposite goals.
Here is diagram of how Omega can influence th destiny of one particular VIP person.

## A Potential Solution from the Physics Side
I was very interested in antigravity propulsion systems and Brown's work on electrogravity. I am sure that we do not need rockets, this is really the technology that will lead to space exploration. A potential solution for creating a low-energy warp drive was proposed by Jack Sarfatti in his work [6].
I'm not an expert in theoretical physics, so all questions about how to implement the device should be directed to him.
Here I will just give some screenshots from his presentations.

# Critique of Everett multiverse theory 

Ontological extravagance: MWI posits the existence of a vast and infinite number of parallel universes. This is difficult to grasp and lacks empirical verification.

The interference problem:  MWI struggles to explain how interference between different universes occurs. Interference is a crucial concept in quantum mechanics, yet MWI offers no clear explanation for it within its framework.

The subjective experience conundrum: MWI doesn't explain how subjective consciousness arises. In Everett's view, each observer exists in an isolated world, never interacting with others. This raises questions about the nature of our unified experience.

Difficulties with testability: MWI is experimentally elusive. It doesn't contradict known results, but it also doesn't predict new phenomena that could be used to confirm or disprove it.

Anthropic leanings: MWI can be seen as anthropocentric, focusing heavily on the observer's experience. This neglects quantum systems that exist independently of human observation.

Lingering interpretational issues: MWI doesn't definitively answer all the fundamental questions of quantum mechanics. The nature of reality and the role of the observer remain open-ended.

Alternative interpretations: Other interpretations of quantum mechanics, like the Copenhagen interpretation and decoherence theory, exist and may offer solutions that MWI lacks.

# A Critique of Faster-Than-Light Travel
Defying Einstein: Our current understanding of physics, based on Einstein's theory of relativity, suggests that nothing with mass can travel faster than the speed of light. As objects approach light speed, their mass increases infinitely, requiring an infinite amount of energy to propel them further.

The Nasty Neighbourhood: Even if we could overcome the energy hurdle, there's the issue of interstellar space. It's not empty; it's filled with particles and radiation. A spaceship traveling at FTL speeds would collide with these particles, generating immense and potentially catastrophic energy.

Time Travel Troubles:  Some theories of FTL, like wormholes,  imply the possibility of traveling backward in time. This creates causal paradoxes â€“ what if you travel back and prevent your own birth? The implications for causality and the stability of time itself are mind-boggling.

Exotic Matter Mystery:  Many proposed FTL drives, like the Alcubierre drive, rely on the existence of exotic matter with negative mass. This hypothetical matter has never been observed, and its existence and properties remain purely theoretical.

The Energy Conundrum:  Even if we overcome the  physical hurdles, the sheer amount of energy required for FTL travel is staggering.  Our current energy production pales in comparison to what would be needed to propel a spaceship at faster-than-light speeds.
