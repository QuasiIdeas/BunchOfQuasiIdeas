# Device for monitoring the level of democracy of the politician in a hypotetical democratic state

The latest Nobel Prizes in Economics were awarded for research directly related to the fact that the long-term welfare of nations depends on the state of democratic institutions. Much depends on the leader, on his psychological characteristics, his personality. Some are more democratic, some are more authoritarian by nature. The policies implemented by a politician can affect society in various ways. A politician whose decisions benefit the majority of people can be regarded as more democratic. But perhaps the concept of democracy as ideal itself is somewhat outdated and requires an upgrade or some kind of transitional form to a more advanced form, such as the futurarchy proposed by Robin Hanson. In this work, I aim to introduce the concept of a politician rating system and propose a device for visualizing this rating.

Requirement: Implement a system to display the "democracy level" visibly on the "crown." or cylinder

Determining the democracy score:
1. Trust in democratic institutions: The level is influenced by how much the leader's actions erode public trust in these institutions.
2. Public opinion polling: Conducted online, where individuals independently evaluate the leader without seeing collective results.
3. Expert analysis: The democracy level may also include findings from studies conducted by experts.
4. Prediction markets analysis: Are set up to evaluate the potential impact of proposed policies on the chosen goal. These markets function by allowing participants to bet on the outcomes of different policies.

Points earned are accumulated in the politician's history so that the most successful politicians can be selected not only by their rhetoric, but by their actions.

The cylinder features an indicator with a scale ranging from "most democratic" to "absolute dictator." It can be integrated with a brain chip for enhanced functionality. Its primary function is to induce temporary adjustments in the nervous system. For example, a lower democratic score might lead to effects such as reduced motivation or a diminished interest in life. Conversely, the more democratic score the politician have, the greater their sense of pleasure and well-being.

Cylinder design:
The structure can utilize a curved LCD screen, capable of displaying the politician score visually, such as through a five-star rating system. The scale could incorporate color coding, with options like a gold cylinder representing a high score. Additionally, the height of the cylinder can vary to reflect different performance levels.

A social interaction scenario can be facilitated using AI. When two politicians engage in a discussion, the AI supporting them could display relevant information on the cylinder's screen. It might act as an impartial mediator, indicating whose arguments carry more weight based on data or logical validity.

Questions:
1. How to ensure access control and protection of the device from hacking?
2. How to ensure that opinion poll results cannot be falsified?
3. How to avoid potential risk from the AGI that could replace the data flow representing the real will of the people with a fake one.
4. How to prevent potential collusion between the administration and the president to replace the crown with a fake one?
5. Will such a device drive the leader into permanent depression?

The answer to question 5 could be a duplicate of the crown that performs the same control signals on a test person selected randomly from subjects unknown to the 
to the president's inner circle.

If people trust the technology, they may view wearing a "crown" or a cylinder as a mark of gentlemanly conduct. However, its use could remain voluntary.
