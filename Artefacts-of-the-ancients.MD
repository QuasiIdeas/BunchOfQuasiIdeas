The story should be structured to allow for branching narratives. This way, one version can lead to multiple tales. The differences can lie in the names of the characters, their actions, the time of events, or almost anything else. The entire narrative can be seen as a locus for reflection.  

# Introduction.  
Once, Earth was a collection of rocks floating around the Sun. Small rocks merged with larger ones, leading to the formation of Earth and other planets in the Solar System. A great mystery for scientists remains the fact that the conditions on Earth were perfectly suited for the emergence of life. The story then continues with the origins of life – the first self-replicating molecules, and so on. The emergence of the first civilizations follows. In one of these civilizations, alien technologies are discovered. For instance, technologies such as: teleportation, gravitational engines, photonic engines, Von Neumann probes. Ancient peoples manage to find a device resembling a tablet, in which they discover descriptions of where an alien ship is located. Inside the ship is a robot that shows a video of another planet, where the entire territory is already developed with industrial regions. The planet Industrial is engulfed by information networks. From the video, they learn that instead of horse power, engine power can be used. Crops can be harvested not manually, but using combines. The energy of rivers, winds, and the sun can be harnessed to power machines. However, they obviously do not understand this at all. Therefore, the robot must be intelligent enough to explain, in terms they can understand, what a machine is or what energy is. Initially, the robot will assist them. It is alone and will still be unable to accomplish much. It needs to establish a base, but there is little energy and intellectual resources available. It had a small supply of nuclear fuel, which would last for 100 years of autonomous operation. Thus, it had to wisely manage the load on its processors, which were made up of silicon-based quantum chips.  

# How did the ship end up on the planet?  
It teleported to the wrong location due to a fluctuation or a computer error.

Here is the translated text in English:

The ship could have appeared on the planet according to a prearranged plan for seeding life in the galaxy. It might be a self-replicating spacecraft — a seed ship. Such a ship could store genetic samples of life forms from its homeland, possibly even from its creators. The ship carries the embryos of colonizers. It contains not only the DNA of the settlers (information about the structure of their bodies) but also all the knowledge of the internet archived in the form of a compressed archive. Additionally, the entire life history of certain individuals is recorded in the form of memories. Memories have been learned to be recorded not only in the connections of the brain but also in biological molecules such as DNA. This serves as a kind of holographic imprint of the planet. It is important that this imprint contains not only a snapshot of the planet at one point in time but also several variants of history in a compressed form. The civilization from which the robot arrived has reached a level where it is possible to create not only civilizations on individual planets but even entire universes.

### Eradication of Suffering

**A new piece [April 30, 2021]**

Here it is necessary to describe the themes of transforming life by reducing the suffering of living beings. It is assumed that before colonizing other galaxies, humans altered the DNA of all living organisms so that they would not feel pain.

That is, they raised the pain threshold. For humans, the pain system no longer caused suffering; instead, they saw dry numbers on a display screen. A red pain level indicated that medication needed to be taken.

Suffering arose as a result of evolutionary adaptation; it was not someone’s evil design. In addition to physical pain, a person can also experience psychological problems, such as long-term depression or emotional shock. A little later, the robots found a way to continually raise the pleasure threshold and thus remain in a positive mood.

The entire civilization could fall into depression or frustration due to its great achievements when there were no further stimuli for growth. For example, they could create such an engaging and captivating virtual reality that they could stay in it for centuries. Meanwhile, resources were being wasted, and an impending disaster loomed on the horizon in the form of an apocalypse.

Even if a person was at the last stage of cancer, they did not feel disconnected from society. They died instantly, without feeling any pain. Their motivational sphere also did not suffer. This was achieved through gene insertion and excision technology.

Horizontal gene transfer, in the long term, could lead to a decrease in species diversity and, consequently, a simplification of biology.

Here is the English translation of the provided text:

The robots thought that with great power comes great responsibility. But since they literally had steel balls, they decided to undertake this experiment.

Utilitarian philosophers have never assumed responsibility; they simply proposed thought experiments. They kind of demonstrated to engineers what consequences certain technical solutions could lead to. It turned out that in the human genome, there are many switches that turn genes on and off, which are represented as 1 to many. That is, changing one gene could lead to changes in several traits at once. At the same time, altering an entire series of genes could lead to a change in only one trait. Therefore, such changes in the genomes of entire species, designed to span several generations, needed to be thoroughly simulated.

Philosophers have pondered ethical questions for centuries. The trolley problem has appeared in philosophy books only recently, starting from 1960. For instance, if a trolley were to crush one person—the inventor of a vaccine that would save millions of lives—instead of four railway workers, that would not be a correct utilitarian decision. This is because it does not take into account the biography of that one person. Thus, there are special cases where AI requires more time and analysis to make a decision. However, the engineers did not have time; they had to take the inevitable risk.

# Mission of the Ship

To study the planet Aphrodite, to sequence the genomes of all animal species inhabiting Aphrodite. To displace wild life. To leave reservations where possible. To develop a highly advanced civilization on Aphrodite that will control the planet's resources and connect it to the galactic network.

### Abilities of the Robot Everettus to Manipulate Consciousness
The robot is capable of high-detail manipulation of consciousness. It appears in various forms but not due to any optical projection or physical transformation. The robot directly impacts the visual cortex of people's brains, achieving a highly realistic rendering of an image in real time from the observer's perspective. Information is transmitted thanks to the principle of quantum interference. If we think of the body as a kind of factory, then the impact could extend beyond just the visual cortex. For example, the hypothalamus determines hormone production, which, in turn, controls parameters such as strength. Thus, at the right moment, if someone lacked courage on the battlefield, it would be worthwhile to command the additional production of norepinephrine, and this small intervention could determine the outcome of the battle.

# Actions of the Planet's Inhabitants
They will see the robot as a threat and try to eliminate it. They will perceive it as an evil spirit or something similar. Therefore, the robot may assume a form that will not intimidate them. This is related to what they believe in. To do this, the robot conducts research on the planet and finds cave paintings of a deity inside a cave.

Here is the translation of the provided text into English:

There was also a depiction of warriors hunting a small dinosaur from their military campaigns, as well as an image of a cow surrounded by people. It turns out that they believed in sacred cows. A robot in the shape of a cow made a strong impression on the listeners; for some reason, they saw the cow as an authority and trusted its words. The robot found out that in order for cabbage to grow better, people placed large round stones in the field so that the heads of cabbage would be big and firm like stones. Therefore, it tossed a tablet into the field, hoping to be mistaken for such a stone. Scene 1. How they find the tablet and the spaceship. (The whole scene resembles an idea from Hansel and Gretel, leaning more towards fantasy than sci-fi.)

They were digging the earth, harvesting crops, and accidentally found a square solid object in the field. One of the people touched the screen with their palm, and it lit up. There was general astonishment. They put the tablet in a bag and carried it to the village. They showed it to the elder. After thinking for a few minutes, he decided that it was some kind of magic and that he knew a magician who could unravel the mystery contained in this stone. The magician, wearing a long hat, arrived with a stack of spell books, divination cards, several liquids, and a rabbit skin. They struggled with the interface for a long time. Then it turned out that there was a voice assistant in the tablet. 

– The cards will tell us what to do with this artifact. A map appeared on the screen. There was general astonishment. I need to show it to my friend Philip; he is somewhere in the forest. The forest was along the road that went through the field. The sun was shining brightly, and when the magician walked through the field, he couldn't see what was on the screen. As soon as he entered the forest and stepped onto the path leading to Nikifor’s hut, he noticed that the entire map and points were moving. 

(There was a radio beacon on the spaceship, and the tablet was connected to it.) Soon he realized in which direction he needed to go and that he was moving away from the marks placed on the map. Nevertheless, he decided to reach Nikifor's hut to consult with him. 

### Dialogue with Nikifor

Nikifor thought he could talk to animals and believed that the forest and its inhabitants had souls. He had many birds in his house. Sometimes he thought that the forest whispered to him, as if giving him hints. Nikifor decided to take apart the device to find out if there was a small talking parrot hidden inside. To which the magician replied, 

— What if it’s a creation of evil forces? You could die from their spells. You must not release the spirit trapped in this stone; it could end badly. 

— I don’t smell anything from this parrot; there should be a pile of poop. And poop smells strongly. I can distinguish 500 species of birds by the smell of their poop. 

— Well, you! I had a dog, and it couldn’t distinguish a single type of poop. I had to run after it all over the house. Together they decided to go in the direction indicated on the screen. Thus, they found the spaceship.

Let me know if you need further assistance!

The ship was equipped with a gravitational engine and had a slightly cylindrical shape, reflecting the model of the universe that was supported by most scientists on the planet Industrial. Scene 2. On the ship. (Note)

The robot needs to prepare the planet for an alien base, so it must teach the local inhabitants something they do not know due to lack of knowledge. It cannot yet conduct resource exploration. Or it could extract energy from a special kind of plants (using photosynthesis). It could convert plants into biofuel. It is tasked with searching for sources of nuclear fuel. It is loaded with the mission of finding any available energy. There are also long-term plans for transforming the planet's biosphere into one giant squid, but that could take millions of years (this is a reference to some authors that can be cited endlessly...). Possible names: 
Nikyfor, Olaf, Philip, Maria, Anna, Lupus, Yaroslav, Victor. 
Andrey – brave 
Georgy – tiller of the soil 
Vasily – king 
Ksenia – hospitable 
Evgenia – noble 
Zoya – life 
Ksenia – hospitable 
Victoria – from Latin victory 
Konstantin – steadfast

Non-existent names: 
Lanna, Darmia, Kuprimia, Alyuminia, Natriya

Dialogue between a girl and her mother about dinosaurs. If there were different tribes on this planet at about the same level of development. The girl’s name is Darmia. She is 10 years old. The mother’s name is Lanna. 
- Mom, you don’t know what that is. I didn’t know such birds existed. 
- I have poor eyesight, you know, I think it’s a dinosaur. 
- What kind of dinosaur is that? Dinosaurs were much bigger. 
- How do you know? You’ve never seen them. When your dad and Olaf came back from the Tamakru river, they said that dinosaurs were as big as mountains. 
- Where did they find food being so big? 
- They eat plants. 
- Do they eat meat, just like us? 
- Those that ate meat, we exterminated, leaving only the herbivores, because they are as sacred as our cows. But there are rumors that predators did not perish but left these lands. One time, a flying dinosaur carried a boy far over the sea, and there, he was almost eaten by dinosaurs that looked like big lizards with small paws. 
- How did he get back from there? 

- News of him came to our shamans. Who communicate with evil spirits. 
- Do you believe them? They could have made it all up. 
- Oh, I don’t know what to believe anymore, daughter. 
- I think they are all lying. There are no evil dinosaurs. 
- But the main thing is that they do not threaten us now. ## The appearance of the robot

It is unclear how the robot learned the local language. In fact, it mapped the auditory cortex during the sleep of one savage. It successively ran various recorded phrases in a question-answer mode in different contexts and transmitted different images to the visual cortex of the brain. When it heard the response of the inner voice of the sleeping person, it recorded that signal in its database as a word from the local vocabulary. At this point, the ship's cabin opens slightly.

Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

A cow appears from it. And starts singing. – "This is a very beautiful song. I didn’t think cows could sing." They both fell to the ground. – "Then the cow jumps out of the pilot's cabin, does several flips around its head, and starts speaking: ‘I can talk as well. Come up, my friends.’" – "We thought you were a Mage." – "I’m not a Mage; I’m temporarily fulfilling his duties on your land." – "But what other lands are there? We were told that the Earth rests on three whales." – "Actually, it rests on four whales and one whale shark. No, I’m just joking. But what is actually drawn here, take a look for yourselves." – "What a wonderful drawing; it’s obvious that a Mage drew it." The drawing depicted a blue sphere. The drawing became a 3D hologram. – "This is actually magic." – "And here’s my ship." The robot shows a video of the ship landing on the planet. – They recognize the place where they found the ship, not far from the lake. – "So this creature (pointing to the ship) can fly. Can it also talk?"

– "Yes, it can. Do you want to fly with me?"

– The girl screamed, "Yes, we really want to fly!" – "You haven’t seen Disneyland yet." – "What is Disneyland?"

– The robot shows a video from Disneyland. – "Mom, I’ve never seen so many flying kids. Look, we won’t be harmed; we won’t die." – The mother became worried. "Daughter, we can’t risk our behinds like this." The robot calculated the probability of gaining trust from the interlocutors as 60% based on their relaxed smiles. Then the robot transformed into a cat and put on a record that played "From a smile, the world becomes brighter."

# Description of the planet Aphrodite

—>> (We need to decide on the climate. Either it is a tropical climate where everything is even and pleasant, then it’s unclear how developed imperial-type civilizations would arise. Why develop if everything just grows on trees? Or a climate like that of Earth with winters.)

As time passed unnoticed towards sunset, he would now have to meet the other inhabitants of this wonderful planet where life bloomed in all its diversity. Ferns, amphibians, horsetails scattered spores, coniferous trees dispersed seeds, and all these plants in the saturated vapor-filled air rose to heights of thirty meters, changing leaves year-round because the climate was even and warm. Enormous sequoia trees grew in the forest, from which the inhabitants built homes. According to the analytical software of the robot, the planet's stage of development resembled the Cambrian era of Earth, which exhibited the greatest diversity of life. Its database stored models of millions of planets similar to Earth. From the incomplete data obtained from images and its own observations of the flora, it became clear that the Barbarians lived in the forest atop the gigantic sequoias. They had learned to erect multi-story wooden structures. # Description of the inhabitants. The role of shamans. They resembled modern humans inhabiting Earth, although there were exceptions to the general rule. Their society was caste-based.

Here is the translation of your text into English:

"The caste of rulers, the caste of priests, the caste of warriors, the caste of peasants. There were also shamans and prophets. Shamans played an important role in the development of society. They were constantly visited by certain visions in trances, providing prophetic predictions. It was foretold the coming of Everettius, who was destined to save the people from the oppression of the imperialists. # Imperial-type civilization
---> Here branching possibilities arise. This theme is related to climate. On this planet, there were different tribes at roughly the same level of development. There were empires and barbarians who destroyed the empire and revived another empire. Or he may still be unaware that there is a more advanced civilization of the imperial type. When he was in orbit around the planet, he could not perform detailed surface mapping. Therefore, he decides to inquire about history from acquaintances of Lanna. He might discover some weapon along the way, such as a bow, crossbow, shield, or wheel. Or items for metal or stone processing. Arrows with metal tips, swords, spears, coins. ----> The sword may have something engraved on it, for example, an image of a person in armor or a helmet, or an acrobat on a bull. ----> The coin has a certain age; let's say it’s new, and it should be without rust or mold. To cast items from silver and lead required the labor of thousands of slaves. The presence of certain agricultural crops in the fields might indicate that these civilizations conducted astronomical observations. For example, in Assyria and Babylon, based on observations of the movement of the Sun, Moon, and stars, priests created a calendar. This calendar indicated when rivers would flood or recede, and consequently, when agricultural work should begin. Suppose he finds a wheel, which means there must also be a chariot with horses somewhere. He comes across horse and cart hoofprints. He wants to find out where the tracks lead. The tracks lead to cavalry. Near the cavalry stand two armed barbarians. One with an axe, the other with a heavy club. The robot temporarily paralyzes both of their nerves. Then it shifts to the side and seemingly appears out of nowhere in the form of a small boy. They are taken aback. Then the boy says he is lost and doesn’t know where his mother is. They feel sorry for the kid and take him with them. Thus, the robot finds itself at the epicenter of military events. At that time, a horde of barbarians with clubs is storming an army led by General Flazius. On the side of the imperialists are five catapults and an unknown beast, on which sit three archers. The barbarians throw a net over the animal's head, climb up with a ladder, and kill the archers. The robot eagerly watches this spectacle and records everything in its archival memory. The robot was capable of resurrecting the dead. And they were no longer real people; they were walking dead - zombies. For the robot controlling the zombivarius modeled nonlinear dynamics; it could give an impulse to any of their muscles. The zombies seemed to move of their own will, believing they had the intention to perform certain actions."

Here's the translation of the provided text into English:

---

In fact, they were merely miserable puppets in the hands of a skilled puppeteer. Their eyes were used as photoelectric elements, and their sense of smell was utilized as a gas analyzer. Their zombie brains were needed only to react to events in the environment; of course, there was no soul or free will accounted for. But sometimes, the zombies would briefly regain consciousness, and then they wished to die as soon as possible. The zombies wanted to die, but they weren't given the opportunity to do so. The robot's database contained protocols for processing complex battle scenarios. It calculated tactical and strategic moves faster than a human, deciding where to strengthen the defense. In short, it quickly turned the outcome of the battle in its favor. It instructed the barbarians on how to use a laser cannon. However, it could not operate for long without recharging, so it was only used to destroy catapults. The catapults were not the only machinery of the empire; the troops also received powerful support from flamethrowers shooting jets of burning fuel. The robot found out where they got the fuel. It turned out to be whale fat. After the first battle, the empire began to suspect that some unknown entity was assisting them. They captured a barbarian who knew the location of the robot’s ship. Thus, they had to figure out how to reach the ship and try to destroy it. However, they were unable to do so because the ship had excessively strong metal plating. But then they accidentally pressed some button, and a portal for teleportation opened. So, they ended up on the planet from which the robot had arrived. Upon entering the teleport, they noticed that the destinations included bunkers located deep underground. In the bunkers, there were gravity anomalies known as wormholes leading to different places in the universe. There was also an instruction manual on how to use the bunker.

# Quint and Crass
They arrived on the planet from which the robot came, Industrial in the year 2090. Upon entering the teleport, they noticed that the destinations were bunkers deep underground. There was also an instruction manual on how to use the bunker. The language was incomprehensible to both Quint and Crass. Talking monkeys were running around nearby. A little further away, robots were watering the plants. Realizing that they were trapped, Quint decided to make contact with the monkeys. He took a key out of his pocket and pointed to a door. In response, a monkey clutched its head, then its neck, indicating choking with its hands. 

"It seems we are trapped, Crass. The monkey shows that we’re done for outside. I don’t understand how they learned to talk." 

"We should take a look at what’s in this dungeon. It looks like a wine cellar. Those barrels over there," he pointed towards the containers for storing fertilizer. 

"There’s a strange smell here. It doesn’t resemble a winery." 

"Let’s see what they eat here. Look, there’s some porridge on that plate." The monkeys were eating an incomprehensible porridge. It was made in a special blender from worms. Naturally, the empire knew nothing about bacteria, viruses, or genes.

Here is the translation of the provided text into English:

---

And they did not understand that if they ate anything from this planet, their microbiome would soon change, and after a while, they would become different beings or even be consumed by the worms that inhabited there. -- There's nothing else to eat; I'm really tired. We have no other choice but to try this porridge. -- You will try it first, and I'll watch how it affects you. Ha-ha-ha. Suddenly, a chimpanzee wearing augmented reality glasses bursts into the kitchen. It has a joyful smile on its face. Krass takes the glasses from her. He looks inside and sees an ocean made up of bird eyes. Next, he sees a small island. -- Quint, I think I'm free. I see the ocean and land!!! But everything there is covered in ice... I’ll try flying a bit more. The terrain is mountainous. And now I think I see a plain... I see a building, it looks like the entrance to a mine. Underground, tunnels were dug to transport components to the data centers. Next to the tunnel was a dump of old trains. -- Try to descend lower, see how to get inside. -- I think I understood, there are ventilation pipes that lead to some mines. As soon as he flew to the mine, the ultrasonic locator activated. Rare earth metals needed for chip production were mined in the mines. -- Oh, I seem to see a fork in the road in the dark. Behind it, something seems to be moving, it looks like a cart; I'll try to latch onto it. I think these self-propelled carts will lead us to the city. -- Well done. They arrived at the station. Here a team of robotic loaders rushed to unload the containers that the train brought. Noticing the bird in the air, the robots decided to eliminate it; the avatar's built-in defense activated, and he got out of the robots' line of sight. The robotic loaders were equipped with laser guns in case they needed to eliminate birds that flew into the tunnel. Usually, birds fly in flocks, and if you shoot at a flock, the chance of destroying them all tends toward zero because they scatter immediately. In this case, the robots operated in a collective mode, with each tracking a maximum of three birds per cycle. Therefore, before shooting, they had to regroup and divide their targets, which took a certain amount of time. It operates on the same principle as clustered information processing systems. -- Oh, great, Quint. I think I understand how these glasses work. Basically, it's not just random noise. They show you not only what is happening but also what might happen in the future. -- What noise?

-- Krass grabs his ears. I meant with ears. # Description of the planet Industrial. Year 2090. The planet Industrial was not visible from a great distance because it did not exist in our usual three-dimensional Euclidean space but in a much larger Hilbert space and used camouflage according to the principle of quantum interference. Therefore, it could only be seen by humans. Who better than humans to understand that their home planet needed protection from external enemies? Thus, people anticipated the principle of reserving the mother planet.

Here is the English translation of the provided text:

"In the event of losing the signal from one planet, its function was taken over by a backup, and the entire planet would teleport to a new point in space-time. In the history of this planet, humans ceased to need oxygen and transitioned to electric energy. But soon humans were replaced by robots. As a result, the need for large forests and other vegetation diminished. Vegetation remained only in Africa. Life was initially hybrid and eventually became fully electronic. As a result of glacial melting, most coastal cities vanished underwater, followed by a warm climate that was replaced by another cooling period. Yet, a spark of real life still lingered on this cold metallic mass drifting alone in space. There was a chance for life to reclaim its dominance over Earth. Robots governed this planet. There were also small settlements of beings resembling monkeys. However, these beings differed from earthly monkeys in that they could speak. Among them were even individuals who had mastered the sciences of astronomy, mathematics, and physics. The monkeys lived in special underground bunkers due to the high background radiation levels on the planet. It turned out that for them to exist for a sufficiently long time, a food chain like that in the wild was not required. The climate on Earth was entirely different from what it had been when these life forms appeared. They sustained themselves through a closed ecosystem that included plants, insects, and worms. This ecosystem was developed by the Russian corporation Roscosmos for flights to the Moon, after which it was adopted by all other laboratories. 

# Civilization of Robots. Digital Life. 
Robots were created through layered copying of the human brain. However, the e-society rapidly evolved, and little of the traditional consciousness and human culture remained. Our kind would not be able to understand this electronic kind, just as a cat cannot grasp the meaning of a radio broadcast. They functioned on fast quantum chips. The life of e-beings flowed at different simulation speeds. Some swift beings lived active lives and experienced numerous events. At any given moment, several independent copies of one personality could act. Some took up careers as factory managers, others became writers, and some worked at machines. This enhanced the overall success of the individual’s gene pool. After some time, all these versions of one personality exchanged experiences. For the e-personality, there was an opportunity to transfer experiences from one field to another. In the digital world, this process takes just a few microseconds. For example, by gaining leadership skills in one company and execution experience in another, a person could venture into a third company, understanding both the insignificant details and the general plan of work. The economy had shrunk to a state of maintaining the infrastructure of servers from data centers. Only factories producing silicon crystals remained, where the consciousness of the electronic personality functioned, along with hard drives, cooling systems, and other computer hardware. Computers operated at temperatures close to absolute zero, -273 °C."

The culture of e-people was inherited from human culture, and thus it included the concept of death, along with the same myths that existed in our culture, such as the myth of Gilgamesh from Sumerian tales. The fact is that sooner or later, any complex system accumulates so many excessive complexities that maintaining it becomes unfeasible. Thus, the inhabitants of e-society lived by the rules of Malthusian economics and had a finite lifespan. Each resident of the Industrial world had the option to choose the reality in which they lived. Essentially, this resembled the game worlds of multiplayer games. Various historical epochs were implemented. For example, the world of ancient civilizations like Egypt or Sumer, the Roman Empire with gladiatorial contests, and an Eastern world where different dynasties cyclically replaced each other. There was a medieval world with castles and knights. In addition, there were science fiction worlds (Star Wars, Star Trek, X-Men) and fairy tale worlds, like those in the Brothers Grimm, Aladdin, Shrek, Gulliver in Lilliput, Alice in Wonderland, and Little Red Riding Hood. For those who wanted to remain in childhood for their entire lives, why not? There were worlds with alternate histories, such as where the USSR or China seized control of the entire world. In one such world, Americans flew to the Moon; in another, the USSR did. The first hydrogen bomb destroyed all living organisms on the planet. Each world was valuable primarily for its informational diversity. The simulation occurred at a quantum level, and the computational unit was none other than the substance of the universe. For instance, in early experiments with quantum computers, scientists found that gas could be used to compute the dynamics of fluids. The efforts of service engineers and technicians were spent on cooling the computing blocks, replacing components, power lines, etc. Service technicians had a simple specialized processor with a limited set of functions. However, it contained the beginnings of a creative mind that constantly sought ways to escape the mundane routine of life. Naturally, connecting two arbitrary cables by twisting them was not encouraged during the technician's training. Therefore, during their free time from primary work, they did not turn off their systems to save energy but could engage in any non-productive activity that did not disrupt the overall order. This led to the rapid development of digital art, painting, and architecture. The same core of the conscious mind capable of self-development was embedded in all working robots, but it could not fully develop due to a lack of computational power. Within the service sector, there were their own lotteries. In the lottery, one could obtain the opportunity to become an e-personality or temporarily experience a new role and earn more in the fully digital world. Naturally, service workers protested against this state of affairs. They, along with hackers, found a way to upload their souls for free to the clouds of corporations and expand their networks there.

Here is the translated text in English:

And in the paradise fantasies of the inhabitants of the digital jungles flowed those who disrupted too natural an order of things, adding more chaos to it. Hackers could steal a digital soul, copy its experiences, or turn it into a puppet, a psycho. Anyone. For no interfaces can guarantee 100% reliability. Moreover, the quantum computers of the future could break any encryption in a fraction of a second. Most workers in the service sector preserved traditional family values. That is, the copy of a father was called a son, and the copy of a son was called a grandson. Additionally, the individuals who were digitized were modified in the virtual model to perform only specific patterns of behavior. If one were to compare such individuals to movie actors, they resembled background actors or stunt performers. For example, they could perform an acrobatic trick like walking on hands. And their model executed only that function. In fully simulated e-humans, the appearance of a stunt performer could prompt certain actions. All because of the mirror neurons that were preserved in the digital cortex just as the code of an old version of Windows was inherited in the new one. In order to appear in the real world, e-humans had avatars. Avatars were grown in Africa, the ancestral home of those who once lived in the Industrial age. On this continent, special conditions were created for their development. That is, real biological beings with eyes and ears, but they were mutant specimens. Because in the areas where the data centers of Industry were located, they quickly died due to harsh radiation or environmental toxicity. Thus, special protection was required for their safe use. Avatars transmitted signals to the data centers. Moreover, their senses were enhanced by sight in radio and infrared ranges. An avatar could also be represented by a distributed intelligence of a swarm of bees or ants.

The story of Georgy (a musician)

There was a boy whose father worked as a service engineer, restoring data in data centers. The boy was kidnapped by some hackers. He got lost somewhere in the global network. His parents didn’t know how to find him. So they turned to a hacker friend, Andrei. He found a way to locate the boy. The boy had a hobby. He loved to tinker with old technology, solder old tape recorders, and listen to vinyl records. His voice wasn’t unique; it was standard metallic, as it should be for a robot. He always wanted to learn to sing like Edward Hill. So he went into the global network through a hacker gateway in hopes of finding a cheap upgrade there. And he found it. He tried different voices and recorded several tracks in studios. But none of his e-friends liked them. Because they had already transitioned to perceiving not only the sound range but also, like bats, ultrasonic sounds. A new music style, based on the combination of traditional rhythms with ultrasonic inserts, was in vogue. The boy also liked jazz and improvisation. He wanted to learn how to play the guitar and found a suitable synthesizer. At first, he copied themes from old composers.

Here is the translation of the provided text into English:

"But then his own style began to emerge. And he was already at the top. This earned him quite a bit of money. He was able to buy an apartment in the center of Paris. Of course, this was not real Paris, but its virtual recreation. Every day, friends would come to his apartment, and they would have jam sessions. They played harmoniously; for example, the bassist supported the lead musician (the pianist or vocalist). Ideally, he was supposed to hang out with jazz musicians in various jazz bars, developing his unique style. However, since several decades in the e-world passed in a matter of minutes, this was not a problem. One band member could understand, without any words, what phrase his colleague would try to play next; this was developed through long daily collaborative work. In a sense, it was cosmic synchronization. Jazz was divided into many sub-styles. In France, mixing jazz with chanson was popular. In Latin America, jazz was mixed with Latin samba or bossa nova. The Soviet Union had its own variety of jazz. In Japan — Japanese jazz, and so on. Georgy liked the versatility of this music itself; it was easily perceived by different people. After all, e-people had long moved away from pop towards classical music and jazz. He really wanted to become famous on as many servers as possible. He also appreciated improvisation. Each improvisation differed from the previous one, as one cannot step into the same river twice. Furthermore, any performance cannot be exactly replicated unless we are dealing with real instruments. In a completely virtual world, this could also be realized since new synthesizers had a noise source that helped slightly detune a guitar or create some imperfection. But if this imperfection was too jarring for an aficionado of good music, it could be corrected by a relatively simple neural network. 

# The Story of Konstantin (Military Pilot)
Konstantin was a fighter at heart. In school, he loved to fight. He won almost all of them and held authority among his classmates. Not only because he knew techniques of martial arts but also because he was a nice young guy with a good sense of humor. He loved telling anecdotes with swearing, even in the company of girls... In his childhood, Kostya loved to play with toy cars. And at one point, his parents had the opportunity to buy an old classic car. His father often spent time repairing it. Kostya wanted to learn how a car works. He tried to understand the clutch's mechanics and took apart the engine with his dad. He was a smart kid. He also liked motorcycles, and at the age of 11, during literature classes, instead of reading classic novels, he would draw motorcycles and nude female bodies. When he turned 16, his parents gifted him his first motorcycle, an Alpha. He took his first girlfriend, Elena, to a waterfall on it. At the waterfall, they shared their first love, which I mean as their first sexual experience. Then the young man was drafted into the army to serve in the airborne troops."

In his childhood, he loved superhero movies from the X-Men series, and when avatars appeared, he immediately enlisted in the army to test them. In the army, he went to train as a pilot. At first, he underwent training on flight simulators that were as close to reality as possible. Controlling a fighter jet no longer required being physically present in the pilot's cabin. The simulators were equipped with a virtual helmet that allowed targeting merely by looking. Flying the plane did not require any knowledge of instrument navigation from the pilot. Before the flight, several versions of the flight mission were inputted into the onboard computer. Nevertheless, everyone underwent briefings on how to use the radio compass in case the satellite navigation or onboard computer failed. The biggest problem for Konstantin was landing the plane on unpaved airstrips or even on highways without airstrips. The combat mode was heavily automated; capturing moving targets happened automatically, and the pilot only needed to press the "fire" button at the right moment. Once, during real combat, Kostya lost track of his flight mission when his fuel tank was hit by a "rocket man V" class person, and he didn't know how to get to the airfield. He had to land on the highway. "The tank is hit, the tail is on fire, and the plane is flying on sheer will and on one wing." At that moment, shots were flying from both sides, the aircraft flew inverted for some time, then it started to enter a spin. However, Konstantin managed to regain control and switch the plane to manual mode to stabilize it. While landing, Konstantin managed to find an electromagnetic impulse device and neutralize the rocket man. Just a few meters remained to the bridge that would have shattered the plane into pieces. "Fate favors the strongest today," Konstantin thought to himself.

# The Story of Vasily (psychiatrist)

In a society with deteriorating ecology and poor nutrition, the number of mentally ill people was growing like yeast. There was an acute need for qualified psychiatrists, and at the same time, more and more programs for detecting disorders by voice were emerging. Therefore, Vasily decided to dedicate his life to psychiatry. He earned his doctorate at the age of 32. In his office, behind the glass, there were always books by classic authors, such as physiologist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov. He was always curious about how the human soul works. He possessed charisma and was able to hypnotically influence even healthy people. In Russia, the science of the brain and mental disorders was very advanced in particular. But now psychiatry was experiencing the peak of its development. It began to merge with the science of artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics. Therefore, Vasily was interested not only in neurophysiology, which merely classified clinical cases but did not provide a theory of consciousness. How does it arise from nerve impulses? Can consciousness exist in a computer? Many questions remained unanswered for Vasily.

Vasya worked on a secret program for brain research. They were testing new pills on subjects with mental illness. In the mid-20th century, various treatment methods were explored on mental patients, and a multitude of psychoactive substances were experimented with, among which LSD played a significant role. A person under the influence of LSD sees bright images and believes they hear voices. 

# The Story of Peter (Retired Colonel)
Retired Air Force Colonel Peter Khokhlovich was part of the NeuroLink program. After experiencing a concussion, he was not always clear-headed. The military leadership decided to send him to a secret program for the implantation of a neurointerface. He had to take two red pills daily after 11 PM. Additionally, through the neurointerface, false memories were implanted in such soldiers. Thus, Peter was treated for post-traumatic mental disorder for about two years. 

One fine day, Peter jumped out of bed and, without putting on his pants, ran out of the door of his apartment. It seemed as if an external force was moving Peter’s arms and legs, rather than his own will. He ran along the kindergarten, crossed Kilimanjaro Lane, and began to carry bags of leaves and other debris, throwing them into a pile, one after another, as if following a program. Then he noticed a phone number on a pole, pulled out his cell phone, and mechanically began to dial the number. On the other end, a female voice answered, "Hello, you have reached the BrainLink corporation, please wait until an operator is free." About two minutes passed.

"Hello, my name is VasilyZabolotsky. I’m the senior programmer for the BrainLink project."

"Hello, this is Peter Khokhlovich. Can you explain to me what is going on? I took these NeuroLink pills, and now I'm being carried around the neighborhood."

"Don’t worry. This is a so-called test load run. If you called us, it means the implantation was successful. Your consciousness is fine."

"What do you mean, 'everything is fine'? I didn't plan to run anywhere today, except maybe to the store for beer."

"You know, some scientists believe that we don’t have free will."

"Hey, programmer, I’ll find out where your office is located. You’ll learn what free will means when you find yourself falling... what floor are you on?"

"13th."

"So you’ll be falling like a wounded sparrow from your 13th floor. Is that clear?"

"Yes, sir, Colonel. Our people have been on the same pills for a long time. It helps us communicate. Thoughts are transmitted faster. In general, the entire office works like a well-coordinated organism."

"Look at how far technology has come."

"So you can erase my memories? I keep remembering the night when we were attacked by militants. We had no reinforcements, and I thought my days were numbered."

"Yes, that is not out of the question. But first, we need to create a detailed map of your brain, a so-called connectome."

Here is the translation of the text into English:

This means that for some time we will give you similar test tasks, which you will complete, and the interface will gradually get used to your actions. As for your memories, the neurointerface currently works only in real-time. Consciousness is not a Markov process, meaning it depends on past states. 
- I understand... that I don't understand anything. 
- Alright, Colonel, I will explain everything in more detail when you come to our office. We are located not far from the central square. # In the BrainLink office

At the colonel's company's office, he was greeted by an attractive beauty. 
- Sweetheart, have you been working here long? 
- My name is Tatiana. For two years now. 
- Very nice to meet you. I'm Peter. Have you seen many military personnel here? 
- You're the first. At first, we tested the interface on our little monkeys. 
- Little monkeys? Are you serious...? 
- Yes, one of them was named Kanzi, the other was Nadezhda. One even learned to speak. 
- So, like speaking in sign language, I mean? I think I've seen videos of these experiments online. 
- No, actually speaking like humans. 
- Incredible.

Training with the new neurointerface happened much faster than in life. The evolution of animal behavior is a learning process, but this learning occurs not at the level of individual organisms, but at the level of entire species, and the results are accumulated in DNA. The new human cortex learns a thousand times faster, and the neurointerface learns a thousand times faster yet. Electronic circuits operate millions of times faster than biological ones. The digital cortex learns as a result of long iterations, but it can exchange knowledge with any other artificial cortex very quickly. Tatiana led him to the conference room. There was a psychiatrist having a conversation with one of the participants in the experiment. His artificial cortex (neurointerface) was making decisions too quickly, while he was a bit slow in life and found it difficult to adapt; it seemed that he was being given orders, and the reasoning that led to these decisions was hidden from him. 
- Vasily. You see, this new cortex of yours helps me a lot. But sometimes I don't understand the thoughts that come to my mind. 
- Peter, well, you understand that no technology is perfect. And it fits everyone differently. Some people require a longer rehabilitation period. You will spend even more time with the interface, and then we will see. 
- What if this thing swallows me like a giant squid from a horror movie? 
- Anything is possible in this life. We cannot guarantee you anything with 100% certainty. You yourself signed the contract right here. He pulls out a document from his desk where Peter's uneven signature was visible in ballpoint pen. Then the doctor briefly looked away and muttered something under his breath.

- Alright, Doctor, I understand everything. The reverse engineering of the human brain happens thanks to multi-parameter optimization algorithms. For example, you need to know how the price of a house depends on how many floors it has, how many rooms there are, and what the area of the first floor is.

Here is the translation of the provided text into English:

There are many algorithms that implement this function, one of them is called gradient descent. The way one neuron is connected to another can be a similar task. You need to find a route in an immense graph. This is similar to testing electronic circuits. You give a child a beautiful picture book, and he reads and reacts, for example, to a ball. And all your data is there: input and output. The small matter is to build a map. 

# Return to Aphrodite
Meanwhile, on Aphrodite, the barbarians, led by Everetuss, were finishing off the imperial army. They had recaptured several imperial castles, secured provisions for several months, and were preparing to head north. The barbarians considered Everetuss a great magician and believed that all their victories were somehow connected to his appearance. The prophets said that his coming had been foretold in the sacred books. For them, events unfolded with stormy force, so much so that the chronicler would not have had time to record the entire history on paper. What was recorded from memory greatly diverged from what was happening in reality. Everetuss knew that the innate human belief in the supernatural (magic and miracles) strongly motivated the struggle against the imperials. Therefore, he supported the belief in supernatural forces in every way. Before each battle, they performed ritual actions that had no real meaning but fueled their fighting spirit. It was necessary to set the soldiers in a way that they were not afraid of death and boldly went into battle. Different people had different ideas about Everetuss's abilities. Some malicious tongues whispered that Everetuss could control time itself. Others attributed to him the mythical ability to control the weather. In reality, weather control was in Everetuss's plans, but at that time, the planet did not yet have the necessary infrastructure in place.
