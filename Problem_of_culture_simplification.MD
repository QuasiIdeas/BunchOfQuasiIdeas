In one of my youtube podcasts I describe the problem that has our modern musical culture.
Modern music lacks the complexity that was in the 1950-60's.
If you compare the piece of music from random car radio from era of John Coltrane to the music that we hear now from ipod you notice that
it is dramatically simpler. I'm not a pro in music theory but I can understand the basics of harmony.
Modern music is simpler not just in harmony sense but also in rhythmic patterns and melody itself.
Here I can redirect you to the famous painting of Esher that illustrates this concept.

If you deep dive to the simulation hypothesis this issue can be viewed from the optics of crude approximation of this simulation.
And resource limitations of the computer that actually execute the code of our reality.
From the science of game engine design we know there are several levels of details in every game engine that exist today.
When the posthuman civilization in Bostrom terms launched the simulation they probably had a bunch of copies of the current world that is a branch of the same original world.
And memory that is allocated for every world is very limited. so they presumably have some kind of greedy algorithm that redistribute amount of free memory beetwen the worlds with automatic reduce in resolution.
On the other hand our musical industry is just a reflection of bad taste.
More simpler mems just propagate and replicate more easily to the network.
We hungry for content of tik tok like services that exploits the system 1 in Daniel Kahneman terms. 
Maybe it is just a network effect. Every music have its own niche. I still struggle to find interesting japaneese jazz music in the youtube search results.
Also i want to make a reference to the famous movie Idiocracy in witch this idea was extrapolated to the absolute absurd.
