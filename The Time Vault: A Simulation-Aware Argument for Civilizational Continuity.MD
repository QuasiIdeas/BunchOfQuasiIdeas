Abstract
This paper proposes a long-duration Time Vault—a robust repository of critical knowledge—whose purpose is dual: (1) to enable post-catastrophic recovery on Earth and (2) to act as a cosmic beacon available to future off-world human colonies or non-human intelligences. The concept blends practical resilience engineering with two philosophical pillars: the simulation hypothesis and the cosmic expansion imperative championed by Carl Sagan and Iosif Shklovsky. If reality is computationally instantiated, deliberate efforts to preserve and disseminate intelligence signal value to whatever meta-system sustains the simulation. Even in a purely physical universe, extending humanity’s knowledge beyond Earth fulfils what Sagan called our “cosmic obligation” to let “the flame of consciousness” spread among the stars.

1 | Why a Vault, and Why Beyond Earth?
“All civilizations become either space-faring or extinct.”
— Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot

Earth-bound time capsules can fail if their host planet suffers unrecoverable catastrophe. A distributed, interplanetary vault network—with nodes on the Moon, Mars, cis-lunar space, and selected asteroids—adds two layers of antifragility:

Spatial redundancy: One planet’s collapse does not erase the record.

Cultural scaffolding: Early colonies inherit a curated starter-kit of language, science, and ethics instead of reinventing basics under frontier pressures.

Shklovsky & Sagan (1966) argued that intelligent life has a narrow window to project itself outward before internal or external disasters curtail its growth. A vault constellation is a practical expression of that projection.

2 | Simulation Signalling and the Ethics of Preservation
Bostrom’s trilemma implies that agent behaviour could influence a simulation’s continuation. A civilisation that invests in long-horizon safeguards may present evidence of worth to the host system. By exporting vaults beyond Earth we amplify that evidence: we are not merely clinging to survival but actively seeding complexity throughout accessible space.

3.2 Content Architecture
Pictographic Primer — universal mathematics, physical constants, genomic code key.

Multilingual Rosetta Layer — 100+ living & classical languages, plus phonetic map.

Sagan–Shklovsky Canon — scanned Intelligent Life in the Universe and Sagan’s Cosmos as symbolic anchors.

Bootstrap Encyclopaedia — low-tech metallurgy, agriculture, medicine, renewable energy.

Ethical Charter — concise statements on autonomy, harm avoidance and stewardship, reflecting both Enlightenment humanism and modern alignment research.

4 | Deferred Execution by Post-Human Industry
Once autonomous, self-reproducing robotic foundries exist (a realistic late-21st-century goal), the entire vault network can be manufactured at marginal cost. The present proposal therefore functions as a blueprint meme: it need only survive cognitively until full automation arrives. Aligning future AGI with Sagan-Shklovsky principles—expand life, protect sentience—will make mass-production of vaults a natural sub-goal.

5 | Counter-Critiques
Objection	Response
“Earthly libraries are enough.”	Terrestrial archives share geographic risk; off-world vaults diversify existential portfolio.
“Low probability of discovery.”	Even a one-in-a-million retrieval justifies the negligible future cost once robotic industry matures.
“Why help alien intelligences?”	Sagan’s Cosmic Perspective: spreading knowledge is an intrinsic good, and potential reciprocal benefits are unknown but non-zero.

6 | Conclusion
Sagan envisioned “a galaxy in which life becomes something grander than we can now imagine.” Shklovsky saw cosmic outreach as bio-logical destiny. The Time Vault translates that vision into a concrete, recursive artefact: built today in prototype, replicated tomorrow by autonomous industry, and ultimately drifting for aeons as silent proof that a small civilisation on a pale blue dot chose to remember—and to share.

We build not in certainty, but in fidelity to the idea that intelligence, once kindled, should never again be forced to light itself from scratch.
