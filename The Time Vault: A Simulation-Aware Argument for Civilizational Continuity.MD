Abstract
This speculative proposal outlines a design for a long-term time vault—a physical repository of knowledge meant to survive global collapse and guide post-catastrophic recovery. Its novelty is two-fold: an engineering vision that draws on millennia-grade storage (e.g. laser-etched quartz glass) and a philosophical foundation anchored in the simulation hypothesis. If reality operates as a simulation contingent on agent behaviour, deliberately increasing the apparent robustness of civilization may influence the simulator’s resource allocation. Thus, the vault becomes both a technological artefact and a meta-level signal of intent.

1. Introduction — Why a Vault, and Why Now?
Traditional time capsules preserve memory; a vault preserves continuity. The goal is functional: to provide reboot instructions for any future intelligence—human or otherwise—forced to rebuild technology from scratch. By embedding self-decoding heuristics and universally recognisable motifs, the vault aspires to remain intelligible across vast cultural and temporal gaps.

2. The Simulation Hypothesis as Rationale
Building on Bostrom’s argument, the simulation-conditionality thesis suggests that continued runtime for a given branch of reality could depend on signals of foresight, cooperation and self-repair emitted by the agents inside. A time vault is therefore more than a storage device; it is an ontological gesture that intelligence in this world is capable of long-term planning and therefore “worth” continued computation.

3. Technical Outline
Longevity targets Survivability ≥ 10 000 years; resistance to moisture, radiation, magnetic fields and biological decay.
Medium Laser-etched fused-quartz plates (cf. Microsoft Project Silica) plus engraved high-durability metals for redundancy.
Redundancy model Hundreds of small vaults, geographically distributed; some public, some hidden.
Content schema (1) Pictographic primer → (2) linguistic key → (3) scientific & cultural canon → (4) bootstrap engineering kits (metallurgy, agriculture, energy).
Discovery affordances Distinctive geometric casing; ferromagnetic locator plates; ground-penetrating-radar markers.

4. Symbolic and Ethical Dimensions
Even with low rediscovery probability, the act of construction carries symbolic weight: it affirms that knowledge merits preservation beyond any single civilization. Ethically, the project commits to open licensing and transparent documentation to avoid knowledge monopolies or ideological bias.

5. Conclusion
The Time Vault is not a guarantee against collapse; it is a signal through collapse. We build it not because we know it will be found, but because it ought to exist—and because some minds, somewhere, may be watching what we do when no one is watching.
