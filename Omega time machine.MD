# Important Information

The ideas presented in this document are pure speculation \ fantasy and are only partially based on the current understanding of the laws of physics. 
I have not found any mention of real working systems of this type in the literature or any evidence of it's existence..

# Omega time machine

Murphy’s Law tells us that there are countless ways to get something wrong but only one way to get it right. On a civilizational scale, this idea extends to the growing existential risks that come with advancing technology. I’ve explored this in detail in my [Time capsule project](https://github.com/Quasikot/BunchOfQuasiIdeas/blob/main/Time%20capsule%20project.md) articles, but here, I want to focus on a different concept: the ability to control time—or even the fate of our civilization itself.

This idea is rooted in studies of UAP phenomena and the possibility of time travel, which general relativity does not explicitly forbid. In essence, such a machine would influence the present by drawing on knowledge from the future. Over a thousand years, it would accumulate an immense amount of data about life on Earth. Imagine the wisdom you’d gain if, instead of living for 75 years, you had over a millennium to observe and learn.

This system—let’s call it Omega—would function like a mind distributed across four-dimensional space. It would be designed to operate within multiple timelines, unlike human consciousness, which is evolutionarily limited to experiencing time in just one direction. Omega could be a creation of our distant descendants, potentially wielded by specialized intelligence agencies working within a 4D framework.

Determining Omega’s exact location in four-dimensional coordinates is a complex challenge. We can even imagine a future where two Omegas exist simultaneously, each working toward opposing goals. Below is a diagram illustrating how Omega could shape the destiny of a particular VIP individual.

## A Potential Solution from the Physics Side
I was very interested in antigravity propulsion systems and Brown's work on electrogravity. I am sure that we do not need rockets, this is really the technology that will lead to space exploration. A potential solution for creating a low-energy warp drive was proposed by Jack Sarfatti in his work [6].
I'm not an expert in theoretical physics, so all questions about how to implement the device should be directed to him.
Here I will just give some screenshots from his presentations.

# Kip Thorne’s Idea of Stabilizing a Wormhole Using Exotic Matter
Kip Thorne, one of the leading physicists in general relativity, proposed a hypothesis about the possibility of stabilizing a wormhole—a hypothetical tunnel in spacetime that could allow for instant travel between different points in the universe or even through time.

1. The Problem of Wormhole Instability
  According to Einstein’s equations, wormholes can theoretically exist, but they are highly unstable:
  
  If a wormhole contains only normal matter, it will immediately collapse due to its own gravitational attraction.
  Any particle entering the wormhole would trigger its gravitational collapse.
  So, if we want to make a wormhole traversable, we need something that can counteract gravitational contraction.

2. Exotic Matter as a Stabilization Mechanism
  Thorne suggested that a wormhole could be stabilized using exotic matter—a substance that has negative energy and creates negative pressure.
  This exotic matter would generate an antigravity effect, preventing the wormhole’s walls from collapsing.
  Unlike normal matter, which attracts, exotic matter repels, keeping the wormhole’s throat open.

3. Possible Sources of Exotic Matter
  Although no known substance has been proven to fulfill this role, there are theoretical candidates:

Casimir Effect: In quantum vacuum theory, negative pressure arises between two closely placed conducting plates.
Quantum Fluctuations: Under certain conditions, vacuum fluctuations might behave like exotic matter.
Dark Energy: It possesses negative pressure, but it is unclear whether it could be used to create such structures.
4. Connection to Time Travel
  If a wormhole can be stabilized, it could be transformed not just into a cosmic portal but also into a time machine:

If one end of the wormhole is accelerated to near-light speed and then returned to its original location, time dilation (according to relativity) would create a time difference between the two ends.
As a result, a traveler could enter one end and exit the other in the past or future.

# The Idea of Influencing the Past from the Future Through Consciousness
Klee Irwin has explored the concept of quantum retrocausality, which suggests that information can travel not only from the past to the future but also in reverse. This idea is based on certain interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as:

The Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics by John Cramer, which proposes that wave functions can propagate both forward and backward in time.
Quantum gravity theories, which suggest that consciousness and observation may be fundamentally linked to information at the core level of reality.
According to these theories, our consciousness may not just perceive reality but also shape it, possibly receiving influences from future states of a system.

How Does This Relate to Consciousness?
Klee Irwin suggests that consciousness is not an isolated function of the brain but could be linked to a deeper informational structure of the universe. In this context:

The future could influence the past through quantum information mechanisms.
Consciousness may act as a "projector" of reality, exerting an effect across different time scales.
Information may exist beyond classical time, allowing for shifts in the perception of past events under certain conditions.

# Critique of Everett multiverse theory 

Ontological extravagance: MWI posits the existence of a vast and infinite number of parallel universes. This is difficult to grasp and lacks empirical verification.

The interference problem:  MWI struggles to explain how interference between different universes occurs. Interference is a crucial concept in quantum mechanics, yet MWI offers no clear explanation for it within its framework.

The subjective experience conundrum: MWI doesn't explain how subjective consciousness arises. In Everett's view, each observer exists in an isolated world, never interacting with others. This raises questions about the nature of our unified experience.

Difficulties with testability: MWI is experimentally elusive. It doesn't contradict known results, but it also doesn't predict new phenomena that could be used to confirm or disprove it.

Anthropic leanings: MWI can be seen as anthropocentric, focusing heavily on the observer's experience. This neglects quantum systems that exist independently of human observation.

Lingering interpretational issues: MWI doesn't definitively answer all the fundamental questions of quantum mechanics. The nature of reality and the role of the observer remain open-ended.

Alternative interpretations: Other interpretations of quantum mechanics, like the Copenhagen interpretation and decoherence theory, exist and may offer solutions that MWI lacks.

# A Critique of Faster-Than-Light Travel
Defying Einstein: Our current understanding of physics, based on Einstein's theory of relativity, suggests that nothing with mass can travel faster than the speed of light. As objects approach light speed, their mass increases infinitely, requiring an infinite amount of energy to propel them further.

The Nasty Neighbourhood: Even if we could overcome the energy hurdle, there's the issue of interstellar space. It's not empty; it's filled with particles and radiation. A spaceship traveling at FTL speeds would collide with these particles, generating immense and potentially catastrophic energy.

Time Travel Troubles:  Some theories of FTL, like wormholes,  imply the possibility of traveling backward in time. This creates causal paradoxes – what if you travel back and prevent your own birth? The implications for causality and the stability of time itself are mind-boggling.

Exotic Matter Mystery:  Many proposed FTL drives, like the Alcubierre drive, rely on the existence of exotic matter with negative mass. This hypothetical matter has never been observed, and its existence and properties remain purely theoretical.

The Energy Conundrum:  Even if we overcome the  physical hurdles, the sheer amount of energy required for FTL travel is staggering.  Our current energy production pales in comparison to what would be needed to propel a spaceship at faster-than-light speeds.
