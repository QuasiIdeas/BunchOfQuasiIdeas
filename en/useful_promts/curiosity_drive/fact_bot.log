2025-07-14 17:26:10,926  INFO     KNOWN [immunology]: Did you know that the concept of time dilation, predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity, suggests that time can actually pass at different rates depending on the relative velocities of observers and the strength of gravitational fields they are experiencing? This means that if you were to travel close to the speed of light or in a strong gravitational field, you could age more slowly compared to someone who remains stationary on Earth, leading to fascinating implications for our understanding of time and space.  |  ratio= 66.67% (2/3)
