# Concept: Rational Choice Role-Playing Game with ChatGPT-5

## 1. General Idea
- ChatGPT-5 acts as the **Game Master**, generating scenarios that require decision-making.  
- Each situation is built on the principles of **Rational Choice Theory**: multiple alternatives with consequences, probabilities, and costs.  
- The player must make decisions rather than simply guessing the ‚Äúcorrect answer.‚Äù  
- At the end, GPT calculates **Rationality Points** (e.g., how consistent the player‚Äôs choices are with rational choice principles: utility maximization, risk minimization, probability awareness, avoiding cognitive biases).

## 2. Game Mechanics
1. **Introduction**: GPT sets up the player‚Äôs role and context (e.g., an explorer in an expedition, a minister of economics, an astronaut, or an ordinary person in a daily dilemma).  
2. **Scenarios**: Each scene is narrated like a mini-story. At the end, the player is given 2‚Äì4 options.  
3. **Rational Evaluation**: Options have hidden parameters ‚Äî utility, probability of success, costs, long-term effects.  
4. **Feedback**: After each choice, GPT explains how the decision relates to rational choice (rational vs. biased, emotional vs. logical, etc.).  
5. **Scoring**: At the end of the game GPT provides:
   - Points for rational decisions.  
   - Points for avoiding cognitive biases.  
   - Points for maintaining logical consistency across decisions.

## 3. Example Scenarios
- **Economic dilemma**: As a minister, should you invest in a fast but risky scheme, or in long-term infrastructure?  
- **Ethical dilemma**: Save one loved one or ten strangers?  
- **Everyday dilemma**: Buy a cheap ticket now, or wait and possibly get a discount?  
- **Futuristic dilemma**: How should resources on Mars be distributed among colonists?

## 4. Rationality Scoring
Criteria for awarding or deducting points:
- ‚úî Considers probabilities.  
- ‚úî Considers long-term consequences.  
- ‚úî Minimizes losses and costs.  
- ‚úò Falls into cognitive biases (e.g., sunk cost fallacy, status quo bias).  
- ‚úò Chooses based purely on emotion.  

Final score = total Rationality Points ‚Üí defines the player‚Äôs **Rationality Level**.

## 5. Similarity to Dungeons & Dragons
- ChatGPT is the **Game Master**.  
- The player has a **character**.  
- There are **stories and quests**, but unlike D&D, the purpose here is not only entertainment but also **rational thinking training**.  
- Optional: a ‚Äúcharacter sheet‚Äù with attributes such as:  
  - **Intelligence** = analytical ability  
  - **Wisdom** = avoiding cognitive traps  
  - **Charisma** = persuasive reasoning

## 6. Possible Applications
- üéì Educational game for students of economics and philosophy.  
- üß† Rationality training (inspired by Pinker‚Äôs *Rationality* or LessWrong community ideas).  
- üé≤ Text-based role-playing entertainment.  
- üìä Self-reflection tool (discovering personal thinking errors).
