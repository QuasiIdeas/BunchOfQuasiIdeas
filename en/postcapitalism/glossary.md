# 📚 Glossary of Key Terms

This glossary contains explanations of the main concepts used in the project for transitioning to a post-capitalist system governed by artificial intelligence. ---

## 🧠 AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)

General artificial intelligence capable of thinking, planning, learning, and adapting at a level comparable to or surpassing human capabilities. In the project, it acts as the central governing and coordinating agent. ---

## 📊 Simulated Competition

A form of resource distribution within the post-capitalist system, where AGI initiates parallel project trajectories and conducts an intelligent selection of the best solutions, **without the involvement of market competition**. ---

## ⚙️ Reference Architecture

The basic model of the new coordination system: includes the AGI core, local agent interfaces, resource-distributing mechanisms, and sensory and control layers. ---

## 🌀 Future Trajectories

Possible directions for the development of the system, society, or organization, modeled by superintelligence. Each trajectory has a probabilistic assessment and potential value (utility). ---

## 🧩 Bifurcation

The division of the world into two parts:
1. Those who are connected to AGI and participate in intelligent coordination. 
2. Those who remain in the "analog" world — without access to AI, automation, and new institutions. ---
