## ðŸ“Œ Why This Document?

This document expands on the idea from `transition_plan.md`, specifically the moral and cultural reorientation necessary for a sustainable transition to post-capitalism. The central thesis is: **incentives for participation and designing the future can replace profit motivation** if basic needs are met by sustainable AI systems.

## ðŸ’° The Old Paradigm: Profit as Meaning

In a capitalist system, the meaning of activity often boils down to:
- accumulation of capital,
- increasing the market value of oneself/one's labor,
- extracting profit. Even areas that are not profit-oriented from the start (science, art, education) have gradually been **subjected to market logic**:
- publications for grants,
- art for hype,
- education for degrees.

## ðŸ§  The New Paradigm: Meaning in Designing the Future

In a post-capitalist system:
- basic needs are **met by an AGI-coordination system**;
- the market **loses its monopoly on resource distribution**;
- consequently, there emerges **internal freedom to choose what to do and why**.  

### Core Values:
- **Participation** â€” contribution to the common cause becomes visible and recognized.
- **Transparency** â€” clarity about whom you are helping and how it affects the future.
- **Benefit** â€” what you create works, evolves, and helps others.
- **Legacy** â€” your activities leave an intellectual, aesthetic, or ethical heritage.

## ðŸ¤– The Role of AGI

AGI serves as:
- **Coordinator** â€” helps people find where to direct their efforts,
- **Moderator** â€” tracks contributions, offers recognition and rewards (non-material),
- **Historian** â€” remembers each person's contribution to the evolution of humanity.

## ðŸ’¡ Conclusion

The transition from profit to designing the future is not a utopia, but a **natural shift in meaning**, if:
- the threat to survival disappears,
- the transparency of contributions increases,
- each individual's efforts become part of a larger, shared context. This is the kind of culture we must begin to **construct now**, even if the system has not fully transitioned yet.
