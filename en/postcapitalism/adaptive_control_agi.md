## Introduction

Traditional planning based on linear forecasts inevitably fails under complex feedback loops and the Lucas effect. Therefore, we are constructing a superintelligence that relies on **adaptive probabilistic-causal modeling of future trajectories**:

* Probabilistic simulations (Monte Carlo) provide a breadth of scenarios,  
* **Structural Causal Models (SCM)** give simulations a logical foundation ‚Äî answering the questions of *why* and *what will happen if we intervene*. This hybrid enables the system not just to predict, but to **purposefully change the world**, minimizing the risk of cascading errors.

## Key Components of the Architecture

### 1. Monte Carlo Simulation of Trajectories

The superintelligence simulates thousands or millions of outcomes simultaneously:

* at the macro level (global economy, infrastructure),  
* and at the micro level (human reactions, technical failures). It **selects resilient trajectories** that continue progressing even amid random "slings and arrows of fate". 

### 2. Cognitive Layer of Causal Models

#### 2.1 Structural Causal Model (SCM)

* Each variable is described by an equation of the form `Xi := fi(Pi, Ui)`, where `Pi` are the parents in the graph, and `Ui` are exogenous factors.  
* The causal graph defines permitted paths of influence and allows for testing the backdoor criterion.  
* Nodes ‚Äî ‚Äúforks,‚Äù ‚Äúmediators,‚Äù and ‚Äúcolliders‚Äù ‚Äî are explicitly marked, which simplifies auditing by safety officers. 

#### 2.2 Managerial Interventions (`do` operator)

Any action is represented as a substitution `do(X := x)`. The planning algorithm executes a sequence of **A-A-P**:

1. **Abduction** ‚Äî conditioning hidden `Ui` on observations,  
2. **Action** ‚Äî substitution of the intervention,  
3. **Prediction** ‚Äî computation of the counterfactual distribution. This way, the system compares the *current* and *alternative* realities before actual intervention. 

#### 2.3 Micro-experiments and A/B tests

To validate causal hypotheses in practice, the superintelligence automatically initiates randomized micro-experiments on sub-agents. This is the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù for eliminating hidden confounding and a valuable source of data for refining `fi`. 

### 3. Continuous Updating of Predictive and Causal Models

Every new event ‚Äî social signal, technological incident, regulatory change ‚Äî is used for **Bayesian updating** of probabilities **and testing causal assumptions**:

* if a **new conditional dependence** is found, the graph's topology is recalculated;  
* automatic analysis of backdoor paths adjusts the list of control variables to avoid confusing correlation with causation. 

### 4. Hyper-adaptivity to Feedback

Even a small event can change the course of the entire system if it opens a new risk branch. A network of sensors and social signals allows the superintelligence to **switch strategies before** an error escalates. 

### 5. Preventive Modeling and Soft Intervention

The goal is not to fight disasters after the fact but to **prevent their evolution**, steering the trajectory towards a more stable course:

1. An anomaly arises ‚Üí a local Monte Carlo simulation + counterfactual is launched.  
2. Probability of a cascade > threshold ‚Üí adaptive sub-agents are activated.  
3. All is stable ‚Üí intervention is not required. 

### 6. Cascading Safety through Counterfactuals

For each critical metric `Yt`, the system generates a pair of counterfactuals *`Yt := 0`* and *`Yt := 1`* and computes the expected loss. If the difference exceeds the risk threshold, a protective strategy is automatically launched. Thus, counterfactuals become a **fast ‚Äústop-call‚Äù** that catches dangerous chains before they unfold in reality.

## Conclusion

The probabilistic-causal approach combines the breadth of ‚Äúforests‚Äù of scenarios with the depth of the **causal root**. This grants the architecture three properties:

1. **Transparency** ‚Äî the path from action to effect can be explained.  
2. **Bias Control** ‚Äî backdoor analysis minimizes false connections.  
3. **Resilience** ‚Äî counterfactual assessment before intervention reduces the probability of cascading errors.

## Further Work

The project plans to:

* create visual diagrams of the causal graph of the architecture;  
* compile a glossary of SCM and probabilistic planning terms;  
* develop a library for automatic A-A-P planning;  
* publish a series of demonstration scenarios on GitHub.
