## üß≠ Purpose of the Document

To outline a step-by-step strategy for transitioning from a market capitalist economy to a system based on resource distribution through intelligent coordination, without money, profit, or wages. 

---

## üìå Key Assumptions

- An AGI system has been created, capable of adaptive management and trajectory modeling. 
- Production capacities (energy, food, housing, infrastructure) are ensured at a level exceeding basic needs. 
- Society is in a state of institutional wear and requires a new type of coordination. 

---

## ü™ú Stages of Transition

### 1. **Creation of Islands of Autonomy (Pilot Zones)**

- Establish experimental territories (cities, communities) where:
  - management is conducted via AI models,
  - market prices for basic services are abolished,
  - distribution is based on demand and need. 
- Introduction of **local interoperability standards** between AIs, sensors, and participants. 

---

### 2. **Parallel Economy of Trust and Requests**

- Creation of prototypes of a system where individuals interact not through money, but through:
  - requests for resources and projects,
  - affirmation of significance and need (at the level of trajectories),
  - voting through attention, benefit, and participation. 
- Launch of prototypes: **"communal AI agents"** instead of HR, accounting, and logistics. 

---

### 3. **Emulation of Competition within the System**

- Development of **internally modeled competition**:
  - AGI creates parallel project trajectories,
  - conducts intelligent selection of the best solutions,
  - allocates resources based on effectiveness rather than profit. 

---

### 4. **Abolition of Wages and the Money Intermediary**

- Transition to providing basic and extended needs through **direct access**. 
- Diminishing the role of money to a ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù for external compatibility (legacy mode). 
- Reducing transaction costs to zero ‚Äî through **information transparency** and AI optimization. 

---

### 5. **Transition to Global Commons**

- Recognition of key resources (energy, computing, infrastructure) as **global commons**, managed in a decentralized manner. 
- Connecting local coordination hubs to a meta-system at the AGI level. 
- Development of open hardware, open infrastructure as the standards of the future. 

---

### 6. **Moral and Cultural Reorientation**

- Formation of a new narrative:
  - value is not in accumulation, but in participation;
  - meaning is not in profit, but in designing the future;
  - prestige is not in status, but in benefit and transparency. 
- Expansion of AI assistants into education, thinking, and life planning. 

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Barriers

- Resistance from elites tied to capital;
- Distrust from the population towards AI coordination;
- Infrastructure backwardness and digital inequality;
- Geopolitical isolation. 

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Possible Tools

- Platforms like **AI Commons OS**;
- LLM models as distribution agents;
- Peer-to-peer interfaces for requests and coordination;
- Ethical and legal AGI trust protocols. 

---

## üìå Conclusion

The transition to a post-capitalist system is not a revolution but an **evolutionary implementation of architectures capable of competing with the market in efficiency, flexibility, and human significance**. AGI does not destroy capitalism ‚Äî it **transcends it**, just as the nervous system transcends muscle.
