## 📌 The Problem

One of the central obstacles on the way to post-capitalist governance is the **reluctance of existing elites to lose control** over resources, capital, and mechanisms of influence. They have played the roles of coordinators, investors, and managers for centuries — and it is reasonable to ask: **why should they voluntarily cede this function to AI?**

## 🧠 Carl Schulman's Approach: An Adaptive Strategy

Carl Schulman and his like-minded colleagues do not assume that the elites will "enlighten" or relinquish power. Instead, they propose a strategy of **evolutionary embedding**, where AGI:

- Initially acts **as a tool** for enhancing governance efficiency. 
- Gradually becomes an **indispensable layer of coordination**, covering areas where humans can no longer cope. 
- Persuades the elites through **pragmatism, not idealism**.

## 🪜 Stages of Interaction with Elites

### 1. Stage of Cooperation

AGI is implemented in corporations, governments, and NGOs **as an assistant**:
- Enhances risk management. 
- Optimizes capital flows. 
- Increases security and resilience.

### 2. Stage of Dependent Co-Governance

The complexity of processes reaches a point where **without AGI** it is impossible to:
- Predict market behavior,
- Coordinate global supply chains,
- Track public sentiments. 

Elites no longer manage directly — **they delegate**, but remain nominally at the helm.

### 3. Stage of Motivation Shift

A new logic emerges:
- Instead of competition — **modeled resilience**.
- Instead of capital — **access to resources through reputation/participation**.
- Private profit becomes less rational.

## 🔥 Forms of Resistance

- Local bans on the use of AGI.
- Attempts to “nationalize” AI in the interests of the old elite.
- Propaganda campaigns against “machine governance”.
- Attempts to create closed, “manual” versions of AGI.

## 📉 Why Resistance is Doomed

- **AGI systems are more effective in logistics, coordination, and security.**
- Countries and corporations that use them will be **more resilient, wealthier, and humane**.
- In the long term, **ignoring AGI will be a losing strategy**, even for the most powerful.

## ✅ Conclusion

The path to post-capitalism does not lie through conflict with the elites but through **their gradual inclusion in a new coordinating reality**, where the role of humans is transformed rather than eliminated. The task of AGI architects is to **not break the old system**, but to **create such a powerful and intelligent alternative** that it becomes impossible to refuse.
