Project: Post-Capitalist Coordination through AGI  

## 1. Purpose

**Global purpose:** Contribute to overcoming the Great Filter for human civilization. **Project goal:** Pilot testing of a post-capitalist governance system based on AGI in a controlled technopark environment.

# Requirements for the Experimental Post-Capitalist Module Project

## Designation

Define key conditions for launching an experimental urban-tech module coordinated by AGI, intended for testing the benchmark architecture of post-capitalist governance. This is not a zone for commercial production, but a long-term "sandbox" for modeling economic and logistical scenarios under AGI management. ---

## Main Tasks

- Verify and refine post-capitalist coordination algorithms using AGI.  
- Maintain a high standard of living for participants by simulating post-capitalist conditions.  
- Simulate the complete cycle of production, logistics, and management within an autonomous and scalable module.  
- Ensure ecological safety and minimal external impact.  
- Validate system resilience through simulated failures and crises. ---

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Physical Environment

- An isolated yet accessible **area** with modular expansion capabilities.  
- Developed **green infrastructure**: parks, ponds, wooded areas, recreational spaces.  
- Residential buildings with **stores**, **pharmacies**, **medical stations**, and (if necessary) a **school**.  
- Recreation and sports zones similar to **Luxoft**, **Google**, **Cambridge**, **Oxford** campuses:  
  - Fitness centers in buildings  
  - Golf and tennis courts  
  - Cafés, lounge areas, art spaces  

### Technological Core

- **AGI already developed and integrated** into all key systems.  
- High-speed and fault-tolerant **internet** and internal network.  
- Data centers and computing clusters connected to local management systems.  

### Production Environment

- **Robotic technologies** (non-toxic, low-volume, modular).  
- Focus on system behavior and coordination rather than market value of products.  
- Simulated abundance with intentional limitation of incoming resources to test resilience.  
- Safety: absence of hazardous materials and emissions.  

### Logistical Architecture

- Redundant **transportation systems**: railways, buses, drones, VTOL, helicopters.  
- **Alternative delivery methods** to model disruptions.  
- Testing of **logistical algorithms** under artificial stress scenarios.  
- Infrastructure for **sustainable operation during failures**. ---

## Personnel

- Basic **interdisciplinary team**: systems engineers, ethicists, cognitive scientists, roboticists, logisticians.  
- **Legal team** to ensure compliance with laws, international standards, and ethical principles.  
- Resident testers living as early participants in the post-capitalist environment. ---

## Key Limitations

- Lack of focus on mass production or market competition.  
- Main output — data, methodologies, and validated coordination protocols.  
- The design must support **scalability** and the potential for replication in other regions.
