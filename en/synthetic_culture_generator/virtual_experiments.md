# The Concept of Virtual Experiment as an Interface with Reality

## 🎯 General Idea

Within simulated worlds where cognitive agents develop, we implement **virtual experiments** as a method of **interface between artificial culture and real scientific knowledge**. This allows for the measured and meaningful **introduction of external knowledge into the simulation** that agents perceive as results of their own actions.

## 🧱 Architecture

### 1. 🧠 Supersystem

> Represents the real world with layers of accumulated scientific knowledge, historical discoveries, mathematical models, observations, and experiments. - Has access to the entire body of human knowledge. - Provides or simulates data in response to agents' requests. - May **interject, filter, or modify information** to maintain the integrity of the cultural simulation.

### 2. 🌐 Simulated Worlds

> Isolated or partially isolated environments where agents develop culture, science, and technology. - Within the world, an agent can **request experimental data** (e.g., in astronomy, chemistry, biology). - It is assumed that the agent "conducted an experiment," but the data is actually **generated or extracted** from an external real source.

### 3. 🧪 Virtual Experiments

> Emulation of scientific activity within the simulation, where the result is controlled by the supersystem. Examples:

- An agent launches a "telescope" → receives real astronomical data adapted to their cultural level. - An agent conducts a "chemical reaction" → receives data modeled on real chemistry but adapted to the conditions of the world. - An agent makes a "discovery" → the supersystem interjects **interpolated or extrapolated** knowledge to test creativity in their interpretation.

## 🔄 Dummy Interface: Transparent Placeholder

> **Virtual experiments** are not real actions but **placeholders** (dummy interfaces) that create an illusion of a full empirical process for agents. - The supersystem can embed data **automatically** or on request. - Supports scenarios of "discovery," "error," "analysis," and "revolutions" in science.

## 🔍 Advantages of the Approach

- **Controlled development** of cultures and agent thinking. - The ability to simulate **alternative histories of science**, including hypothetical discoveries. - The capability to set **accelerated development trajectories**, directing agents toward necessary forms of thinking.

## 🧬 Ethical and Philosophical Considerations

> An agent requesting data **believes** they obtained it through their own experiment. > But, in reality, it is a **knowledge injection** from the supersystem. This approach raises questions:

- Does the origin of knowledge matter if it works?
  
- Can a culture entirely built on injections from outside be autonomous?
  
- When an agent becomes aware that "experiments" are merely interfaces, **what will happen to their ontology?**

## 💡 Extensions

- The ability to vary the **level of accuracy** of data (true, noisy, misleading). - The possibility of substituting the laws of nature in individual simulations. - Keeping a log of data issuance → exploring the dependencies between input and cognitive dynamics.

If you would like, I can:

- Create a diagram of the architecture (supersystem — agent — interface). - Add this as a module to the main project on synthetic cultures. - Prepare illustrations of the dummy interface or the agent's laboratory.
