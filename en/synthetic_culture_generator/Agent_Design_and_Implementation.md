# Designing and Implementing Agents

## Purpose
To define what an "agent" is within the Synthetic Culture Generator system and how such agents can be implemented, evaluated, and developed in a simulated or post-AGI context. ---

## Types of Agents

1. **Memory-based LLM Agents**
   - Based on architectures like GPT-4, GPT-5+
   - Equipped with long-term memory and dialogue history
   - Capable of self-reflection and narrative development

2. **Embodied Simulated Agents**
   - Operate in virtual worlds (e.g., Smallville-like simulations)
   - Have social goals, cultural modules, and internal drives

3. **Meta-Agents (Subcultures)**
   - Collections of LLM-personas with varying traits
   - Simulate cultural evolution through inter-agent interaction

4. **Post-AGI Level Cognitive Agents**
   - Minds at AGI-level with intelligence surpassing human
   - Capable of developing their own synthetic ethics, aesthetics, and mythology

---

## Basic Requirements for Agents

- **Long-term memory**
- **Cultural coding and internalization**
- **Theory of mind**
- **Autonomous goal-setting**
- **Ability to deviate from norms**
- **Generation of novelty**
- **Metacognition (self-assessment)**

---

## Execution Environment

- LLM-based platforms (multi-agent dialogues)
- Simulated cities/cultures (Unity, Unreal, symbolic engines)
- Specialized sandboxes with feedback and observing agents

---

## Interaction Formats

- Text discussions (dialogues between LLMs)
- Creation of cultural artifacts (stories, visual styles, rituals)
- Simulations of argumentation and negotiation
- Reputation systems and novelty assessment by other agents

---

## Agent Lifecycle

1. **Genesis** — initialization with initial cultural parameters  
2. **Development** — interaction with other agents and data  
3. **Divergence** — deviation towards a unique worldview  
4. **Creation** — generation of new myths, memes, values  
5. **Feedback** — evaluation from the metasystem  
6. **Evolution or Termination** — integration into the system or removal

---

## Future Directions

- Integration of agents into collaborative cultural evolution with humans  
- Training on synthetic multicultural corpora  
- Tracking the emergence of genius within agent communities.
