## Goal

To create an environment within a data center that simulates the development of science, including:
- the emergence of experimental data,
- the generation of scientific hypotheses and theories,
- the interaction of agents with tools and knowledge,
- a gradual approach to "genius" discoveries (in the spirit of Einstein, Newton, etc.). This simulation will allow:
- testing cognitive architectures (LLM + tool-augmented agents),
- refining the mechanism for generating scientific novelty,
- reproducing and accelerating scientific progress in a controlled environment. ---

## ðŸ”§ System Structure

### 1. Agent Cognitive Platform

- **Base Level:** LLM with reasoning capabilities, chain-of-thought, memory.  
- **Add-ons:** external tools, plugins, code interfaces, access to databases.  
- **Types of agents:** theorists, experimentalists, engineers, systematizers, critics.  

### 2. Knowledge Evolution Mechanism

- **Input Data Stream:** synthetically generated "experiments," as if occurring over time (chronologically).  
- **Publication Mechanism:** new articles, hypotheses, debates among agents.  
- **Phase Transition:** agents formulate theories that generalize previous data.  
- **Genius Filter:** models emerge that produce unexpected yet explainable theoretical leaps. ---

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Cycle of Scientific Development

1. An agent receives results from experiments akin to Galileo's.  
2. It builds a model, from which "Newtonian" physics gradually emerges.  
3. In another generation of the simulation, the agent receives data on the movement of light â†’ builds a more general theory â†’ an analog of Einstein emerges.  
4. Elements of quantum uncertainty are introduced â†’ a simulative revolution in physics is triggered. ---

## ðŸ§¬ Features of the Environment

- **Controlled Data Flow:** simulated datasets appearing according to a pre-determined historical logic.  
- **Feedback:** the super-system analyzes which theories and models have proven productive.  
- **Information Compression as a Criterion:** priority is given to models that explain more with less means. ---

## ðŸ“š Inspiration and Sources

- The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (T. Kuhn)  
- GPT+tool-use architectures  
- Generators of synthetic datasets (ALPACA-style)  
- Simulative environments (Voyager, Smallville, CAMEL)

## ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion

> We can not only train AI on ready-made datasets â€”  
> we can **simulate science itself as a living process**,  
> from experiment to theory, from theory to invention,  
> and create an environment where **genius** is not an accident, but the result of directed cultural-scientific evolution.
