## üìå General Approaches to Simulation

1. **Substitution of Experimental Data**  
   If agents request a result ‚Äî a pre-calculated answer is provided from a meta-system.  
   
2. **Dummy Interface**  
   Feedback is simulated through an interface that provides data on behalf of the experimental environment.  
   
3. **Pseudo-equipment Interfaces**  
   Agents see the GUI of laboratory instruments, but calculations are carried out outside their environment.  
   
4. **Feedback on Experiment Validity**  
   In case of incorrect setup, an error or noisy result can be returned, simulating a failed experiment.  
   
5. **Access Limitation to Future Knowledge**  
   All data is filtered according to the epoch ‚Äî agents receive only the information that could have been available to their culture.

## üìé Implementation Notes

- Implementation may rely on platforms such as **NVIDIA Omniverse**, **Unity**, **MuJoCo**, **OpenAI Gym**, **SciPy**, **RDKit**, **Qiskit**.  
- If credible simulation is not possible, the use of **expert assessments** or **falsified data** consistent with the scientific logic of the era is allowed.  
- A central repository of results allows agents to share discoveries and synchronize their theories.

## üß† Relation to the Task of Simulating Genius

Virtual experiments serve as the interface between the simulated agent and real scientific knowledge. Through them, the agent "learns" about the world, tests hypotheses, and either makes a brilliant discovery or encounters false leads. This is the key element in assessing cognitive capability.
