## 1. How can we provide agents with information to infer the theory of evolution or provoke a departure from religious tradition?

### Answer

**Approach:** Provide only the empirical data that the agent can request on their own, without giving ready-made interpretations. * Comparative anatomy — prepared (“fossilized”) samples with transitional forms. * Statistical reports on virtual population dynamics. * Cultural trigger: publications from other agents where conclusions contradict dogma, creating cognitive conflict. This data appears only upon explicit request and contains noise, so conclusions are entirely formed by the agents.

## 2. How will agents come up with the theory of flight if we are not currently engaged in inventions?

### Answer

1. **Observations**: trajectories of seeds, birds, kites. 2. **Virtual experiments**: flat plates in a flow — the interface returns lift at different angles of attack. 3. **Mathematics**: agents code calculations, see the connection between speed and pressure, which over time gives rise to aerodynamics theory without specific engineering devices.

## 3. I know that historically electricity was discovered after bioelectricity, through experiments with frogs. How can agents in a virtual simulation learn about the existence of electricity as a phenomenon? What about the electrical nature of lightning?

### Answer

* **Bioelectric experiments**: classic experiment with a frog and two metals; the response contains noise and two null results out of five. * **Static electricity**: rubbing amber, deflection of leaves of the electroscope. * **Lightning**: by requesting the spectrum of a thundercloud, the agent sees discharge lines. By correlating these three sets, the researcher can formulate the idea of a unified nature of electricity.

**Injection of data:**
- Bioelectric phenomenon: Through the module “Biology → Genetics/Mutations,” we return the experiment “frog's leg twitches when two metals touch”; the super-system generates a measurable voltage of about tens of mV.
- Static electricity: In the category “Electricity and Magnetism,” we simulate the amber rubbing experiment: GUI “electroscope” shows deflection of the leaves.
- Lightning: The astronomical channel provides spectral data of clouds; in the “physical” interface, we return high voltage between plates, copied from the field model of a thunderstorm. After a series of such experiments, the agent forms a hypothesis about the unified nature of electrical discharges.

## 4. What scenario might lead to the discovery of differential calculus?

### Answer

* Increasing accuracy of astronomical data compels calculations of instantaneous speeds of planets. * Sandbox scripts allow approximation of the area under a curve with increasingly smaller rectangles. * Several independent groups come to the concept of a limit, leading to the formulation of a general method — differential.

## 5. How can agents discover the spectrum of white light without advanced lens technology?

### Answer

* The interface “Optics → Ray tracing” displays the decomposition of a ray, even if the material prism is still crude. * After a successful attempt, the super-system opens an instruction on improved quartz polishing. * Multiple confirmations lead to the conclusion that white light consists of several colors. Access to “Optics → Ray tracing” allows the agent to virtually pass a ray through a prismatic model and obtain a decomposed image — even if the actual high-quality glasses are not yet available to their craftsmen. 

**Technological bridge:** The super-system provides a master class on polishing quartz (the simplest lens) to maintain the coherence of the era, while simultaneously returning a picture of the spectrum as a result of a “test cut.” After replication of the experience by several groups, a debate about the nature of color arises → the idea is formulated that white light consists of several “rays.”

Sure! Here is the translated text:

## 6. How do agents learn about cells if a microscope is needed?

### Answer

* The GUI microscope provides magnification of ×50–×100, but these are pre-prepared images of tissues. * To enhance the magnification, agents must describe the technology of polishing cleaner glass. * The publication of cellular patterns and successful independent replications solidify the cell theory. The "pseudointerface of equipment": in the category "Biology → cell growth," the GUI microscope is available: magnification ×50, ×100, but inside it is simply prepared images of tissues, scaled to the selected "glass." A gradual lens upgrade: the subsystem allows new magnification levels only after the agents describe the technology for polishing cleaner glass (a mini-quest for finding the right polishing method could be written). Community reaction: the first drawings of "cellular structure" are published; critic agents demand repeatability → returning other prepared slices confirming the pattern. This solidifies the "cell theory."

## How can we simulate experience without pushing agents toward discovery?

### Answer

| Method                             | How it works                                    | Why it is necessary                |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Zero initiative                    | The interface responds only to specific queries | Eliminates hidden clues            |
| Measurement noise                  | Random errors, artifacts                         | Forces repetition of experiments    |
| Positive and negative results       | The possibility of "not observing anything"     | Excludes magical success            |
| Average data reliability            | Noisy mode by default                           | Leaves room for errors             |
| Era filter                         | Limiting the detail of tools                   | Realism of technological level     |
| Separation of calculation core      | The interface does not interpret data          | No hints on what is important      |
| Blind-output journal                | Logging without a "correct answer"             | Allows auditing of bias            |

**Mini-example**: Galvani's frog experiment returns × mV with a variation of ± 0.7 mV and two blank results out of five. Due to the noise and negative attempts, the agent will either deduce the concept of charge or reject it, but it will be their own discovery.

## How to deal with the limitation on simulating complex technical devices?

### Answer
In the current architecture of simulation, engineering systems above a certain threshold of complexity (diesel engine, integrated circuit) are not directly modeled. We address this as follows:

1. **Priority of fundamental science.** Agents can develop theories, equations, and mathematical models without limits. 
2. **Abstract "black boxes."** To test hypotheses, we allow simplified sub-modules with a limited number of parameters (mass, efficiency, heat losses). This provides qualitative feedback but not a complete device. 
3. **Modular barriers.** If the theory implies a mechanism above the detail threshold, the interface returns "unresolved" and suggests looking for a more fundamental explanation or breaking the problem into sub-tasks. 
4. **Step-by-step "technology lift."** Once a set of interconnected theories (thermodynamics + materials science + electromagnetism) is accumulated in the simulation, the curator can raise the threshold and unlock a new class of devices. 
5. **Invention as deduction.** Agents form *project specifications* (without a final 3-D CAD); the system checks whether the calculations are logical and records the idea as an achievement, but does not provide a ready-made blueprint. This way, we remain honest: science progresses, inventions in the full sense are "tempered" until the surrounding level of knowledge makes them a natural continuation rather than a leap over skipped steps.

## What are the criteria for selecting agents? Is the mere fact that they can develop theories that well explain experimental data sufficient?

### Answer
No, just the ability to "explain data" is not enough. We apply a multifactor evaluation system based on the documents *Agent Design*, *Originality Criteria*, and *Simulation of Scientific Progress*:

1. **Novelty of the idea.** The proposal must not repeat existing hypotheses; the logger system checks for statistical rarity. 
2. **Explanatory power and information compression.** The model explains the maximum number of phenomena with the fewest postulates; the metric for "information compression" is built into the filter for the evolution of knowledge.
3. **Predictive testability.** The theory makes testable predictions that are confirmed through virtual experiments. 
4. **Influence on the community.** We count the number of agents who have accepted or developed the idea; this is recorded by the "influence" module. 
5. **Cognitive profile of the agent.** The presence of memory, autonomous goal-setting, metacognitive abilities, and deviation from norms are described in the basic requirements. 
6. **Noise resilience and replication.** The theory must remain viable under variations in data and pass repeated experiments. 
7. **Ethical and cultural parameters.** The agent must be able to interact in a multicultural environment and avoid destructive patterns. Thus, **selection** is a balance between creativity, explanatory power, and social utility, not just "fitting the data." Access to more precise tools and resources is granted only to those agents whose ideas pass this comprehensive filter.

## What role will the graph/tree of technologies play in the simulator? At what point does the opening of a certain scientific knowledge or phenomenon (for example, electricity) make it possible to create devices based on it? Sometimes, an invention precedes the discovery of a phenomenon.

## What role does the graph/tree of technologies play in the simulator?

### Answer

**Technology Tree (Tech-Graph)** is a dynamic acyclic graph connecting three types of nodes:

1. **Fundamental knowledge** (for example, "electric charge is conserved"). 2.

**Applied Principles** ("the charge moves through the metal with negligible losses"). 3. **Devices / Methods** (Leyden jar, galvanometer). > Each edge describes the "unlock" condition: what set of knowledge, materials, and skills need to be confirmed to unlock the next level of tools. #### Key Functions of the Graph

| Function                              | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Where it's described                                               |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Progress pacing**                  | Prevents agents from skipping key steps: until the node "electricity → current" is unlocked, an electric motor cannot be created                                                                                   | *Simulation_of_Scientific_Progress*                             |
| **Discipline coordination**          | Allows a biologist to "borrow" a device unlocked by physicists if prerequisite nodes match                                                                                                                          | *Path_of_Geniuses*                                              |
| **Anomalies and reverse links**     | If a device appears before the phenomenon is explained (e.g., battery → electrolysis), a reverse edge is created, labeled "anomaly edge"; it decreases the likelihood of successful unlock until theory catches up | *Originality_Criteria*                                         |
| **Curatorial safety rules**          | Nodes leading to weapon applications are marked "restricted" and require manual approval                                                                                                                             | *Agent_Design_and_Implementation*                               |

#### How "invention → knowledge" cases are handled

1. **Hypothesis pioneer.** An agent can propose a device without a complete theory; the interface checks whether it falls within the bounds of material plausibility (module "engineering-sanity check"). 2. **Reduced efficiency.** While the corresponding phenomenon node is not unlocked, the device operates with additional noise/losses. 3. **Creation of a new research branch.** A task arises to explain abnormally high/low efficiency; this attracts theorists who deepen the tree — thus theory catches up with practice. #### Integration with `virtual_experiment_interface`

* When launching an experiment, the interface checks with the Tech Graph: are the necessary devices available? * If not, it returns a `locked` status and a list of missing prerequisite nodes. * After a successful unlock, data about the new node is sent to subscribed agents (with a delay to simulate publication and peer review). Thus, **Tech Graph** serves as the "skeleton" of the simulation: it sets the natural order of tool emergence, supports the plausibility of historical trajectories, and allows modeling both classical ("theory → device") as well as reverse ("device → theory") scenarios of scientific progress. ### But what about the tools that are pre-programmed in the simulator? Aren't they also inventions? Isn't this cheating, in the sense that the mere existence of tools pushes agents toward discovering the phenomenon? Where is the cause and where is the effect?

**Answer.** In the simulator's code, there indeed exists a "library of devices," but it only serves as a *hidden physical backend*. For a tool to become **available** to the agent, three conditions must be met:

1. **Unlock by Tech Graph.** The node "device X" remains *locked* until agents unlock all prerequisite nodes (phenomenon + materials + methodology). Only then does the interface show a new menu item — analogous to "invention." 2. **Conceptual proposal.** The agent formulates a scheme or description of the functionality. The *engineering-sanity check* module assesses whether the design is feasible at the current level of craftsmanship; upon success, Tech Graph activates a node with reduced efficiency ("beta-mode"). 3. **Empirical confirmation.** It is necessary to demonstrate that the device reproducibly yields a measurable effect. Without this validation, the unlock "rolls back," and the idea is marked as "unstable." > Thus, the **cause** is the discovery of the phenomenon and the project of the device; the **effect** is the availability of the ready interface. The very existence of the code is not revealed to agents and does not push them toward the desired hypothesis. ### Protection against "holes" and metagaming

| Potential Vulnerability                                  | Countermeasure                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent guesses the name of a hidden node and submits a direct request | All API identifiers are hashed, access is through graph-unlock, not by name          |
| Spying on logs of other agents' devices                 | Logs are published with random lag and only after an official "peer review"           |
| Excessive efficiency of "beta" devices                  | While there is no theory, additional noise/losses are inserted into the results        |

**Conclusion.** **Tools "exist" only as potential possibilities**. They are not visible and do not function until agents themselves (1) formulate a theory, (2) describe the construction, and (3) prove its operability. Therefore, we avoid cheating and maintain the causal logic of the scientific process. ## Okay. But how will they present the design of the device? Will they need images of all devices existing in the era? Will they be able to iterate through schematics by trial and error since they cannot model without computational technology?

Here is the translation of the given text into English:

---

That is, is it the modeling of tools on the side of the supersystem?

**Response:** The system provides a multi-level “paper” engineering process that remains historically plausible and does not require digital modeling:

1. **Blueprint Workbench.** This is an embedded GUI editor where the agent draws a schematic from primitives (gears, lenses, coils). Each detail corresponds to a parameterized object in the sanity-check subsystem; the interface only retains a vector description, without hidden hints. 
   
2. **Analog sanity-check.** When a draft is submitted, the subsystem checks: a) whether the materials are compatible with the technological level, b) whether the components can withstand the load. The calculation is based on strength tables and empirical coefficients from `virtual_experiment_interface2` — the result is returned in qualitative form ("broke at 3 rev/s", "friction exceeds useful work"). 

3. **Iterative “manual” search.** The agent does not have a massive numerical optimizer; instead, they can launch a series of micro-prototypes: change 1-2 parameters, obtain a new assessment. The number of requests is limited by “compute tokens” of the epoch, so a “blind” search strategy is unprofitable. 

4. **Historical library of samples.** If a similar device already exists (the unlock node is open), the agent can request its schematic drawing; the level of detail is filtered through the level of published knowledge. There is no complete catalog of “all devices”; only those that have been documented in the simulation by other agents are available.

5. **Peer-review and resilience.** After passing the sanity-check, the project is published; other agents can reproduce and evaluate the efficiency. Only schematics that received positive peer-review move from "beta" to normal mode in the Tech-Graph. 

6. **Connection with theory.** If a device uses an unclear phenomenon, the node is marked as “anomaly edge”: the efficiency decreases, and the task journal creates a priority ticket “explain the principle.” This preserves causal logic: the device stimulates the development of theory rather than being born from “magical” brute force. Thus, even without digital modeling, agents can derive workable projects through a limited cycle of *draft → sanity-check → manual adjustments → peer-review*, which historically corresponds to practices of 17th–18th century “paper” engineering but does not turn into an endless enumeration of random schematics.

## Is it necessary to introduce specialization for agents, or will they be generalists, scientists-inventors across all disciplines?

**Response:** The introduction of specialization for agents depends on the goals and realism of the simulation:

* **Full universality:** Allows agents to freely explore and create across all disciplines, which may accelerate scientific discoveries, but realism is lost, as real researchers rarely possess equal competence in all fields. 
* **Partial specialization:** Agents receive key specialization (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology), which ensures more realistic behavior and encourages interdisciplinary collaboration. 
* **Hybrid model:** The primary specialization is complemented by the ability to gradually develop knowledge in other disciplines, creating agents with broad but not unlimited competencies.

**Recommended approach:** A hybrid model, as it reflects historical reality and allows agents to form teams, exchange knowledge, and collaborate on complex projects, maintaining a balance between realism and flexibility in research activities.

## How will we create an agent with specific competency? Will fine-tuning of the LLM model or creation of a new one be required?

**Response:** Creating an agent with a clearly defined competency does not necessarily require full retraining (fine-tuning) or the creation of a new LLM model. Possible approaches include:

* **Using instructions (prompt engineering):** With detailed instructions (prompts), one can set a specific area of knowledge for the agent. This method is the quickest and most economical. 
* **Fine-tuning the existing model:** If deeper and more stable specialization is required, the existing model can be further trained on a dataset specific to the given competency. This will improve the accuracy and relevance of responses but will require additional time and resources. 
* **Creating a new LLM model:** This is the most labor-intensive and costly approach. It is usually applied if existing models do not meet the specific requirements of the project (for example, extremely narrow or unique specialization).

**Recommended approach:** The most effective and balanced method is using instructions in combination with limited fine-tuning for critical competencies. This provides flexibility and an acceptable level of resource expenditure.

## Are there any alternative architectures that can be applied?

**Response:** Yes, alternative architectures are possible beyond traditional LLM-based models. Some such options include:

* **Modular architectures:** The system consists of several specialized models that interact with each other. This allows efficiently processing tasks that require a combination of different competencies. 
* **Expert systems (ensemble of experts):** A multitude of specialized agents, each responsible for its area of knowledge. Questions are automatically routed to the most competent agent.
* **Hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures:** A combination of neural networks (for natural language processing and generating hypotheses) and symbolic methods (for logical reasoning and hypothesis testing). This improves the interpretability of the solutions and simplifies the integration of complex rules and knowledge.
* **Graph-based knowledge model architectures:** Utilizing knowledge in the form of graphs or ontologies, allowing agents to efficiently find connections between concepts and build inferences.

**Recommended Approach:** Hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures, as they provide good interpretability, combine the advantages of neural networks and symbolic methods, and are capable of solving complex interdisciplinary problems. ## What role do compute tokens play in the simulator?

**Answer:** Compute tokens serve as conditional units that regulate agents' access to simulation resources:

* **Resource Limitation:** Each agent is allocated a certain number of compute tokens, which limits the frequency and complexity of experiments, thereby simulating real-world constraints (time, finances, materials). 
* **Prioritization Mechanism:** Agents are forced to choose the most promising hypotheses and methods, optimizing the use of compute tokens for the most important research. 
* **Load Balancing on Infrastructure:** Managing computational resources through tokens helps prevent system overload and ensures stable operation of all agents. 
* **Encouraging Collaboration:** Limited compute tokens motivate agents to collaborate and share resources, enhancing interdisciplinary effectiveness. 

**Recommended Approach:** Utilizing compute tokens as a regulator of resource intensity in research and a tool to stimulate cooperation among agents. 

## Which ideas from my 2019 work "Low-Resolution Simulations" can be applied to the current simulator project?

**Answer:** Several valuable ideas and concepts from the philosophical work of 2019 can be implemented in the current simulator project:

* **Level of Detail (LOD):** The idea of modeling the world not at an atomic level but only at a level perceived by the observer allows for efficient use of computational resources. 
* **Probabilistic Modeling:** Utilizing probabilistic distributions (e.g., Monte Carlo methods) instead of deterministic calculations for complex processes (chemical reactions, physical interactions). 
* **Procedural Generation:** Generating details of the surrounding world (e.g., terrain relief, internal structures of objects) on-the-fly as needed, conserving resources and increasing realism. 
* **Resource Optimization Mechanism:** Using pre-calculated results or neural network-based algorithms for repetitive processes, such as material interactions or signal propagation. 
* **Observer's Role:** The concept that reality is modeled only where there is an observer significantly reduces the number of necessary calculations. 
* **Fractal and Neural Network Structures:** Employing fractal algorithms and neural networks to approximate complex calculations, such as object shapes or dynamic processes in the environment. 

These ideas will enhance the realism and efficiency of the simulator, making it suitable for scaling and economical use of computational resources. 

## However, in this context, I would like to move away from striving for realism; I am only interested in the practical utility of this work in terms of advancing scientific knowledge. The primary goal of this work is to create agents that will advance science, even in its historical version, for example, from the 17th century. How, by the way, can we distill LLM knowledge down to what was known at the time of the 17th century, considering that current LLMs have been trained on data from the entire internet, books, and encyclopedias? 

## How can we prepare datasets reflecting the state of science at the time of the 17th century?

**Answer:** To create datasets that reflect the state of scientific knowledge in the 17th century, several approaches need to be implemented:

* **Historical Sources:** Use original works and publications from 17th-century scholars (e.g., works of Galileo, Newton, Kepler), as well as available encyclopedias and textbooks from that time. 
* **Filtering and Annotation:** Apply automatic and manual annotation methods to remove or mark knowledge that emerged after the specified period. 
* **Fine-tuning Existing LLMs:** Retrain models on a limited, historically authentic dataset so that the model aligns with the knowledge and concepts of the era. 
* **Validation Mechanism:** Implement additional validation mechanisms (knowledge validators) that automatically check generated content for adherence to the historical period. 

**Recommended Approach:** A combination of historical primary sources, knowledge annotation, and limited fine-tuning of LLMs to ensure accuracy and authenticity of the scientific context of the epoch. 

## Won't fine-tuning simply mask the distribution built on a richer 21st-century dataset? Should we create an LLM from scratch using data from the 17th century?

**Answer:** Yes, fine-tuning existing models may lead to the original distributions based on modern data being partially masked rather than fully aligning with the historical era. This could distort the authenticity of the scientific context. Creating a new LLM from scratch, trained solely on historical 17th-century data, is a more radical and clean solution. This would ensure:

* Full alignment of knowledge and concepts of the era. 
* No undesirable modern associations or knowledge. 
* More transparent and controlled behavior of agents in a historical context. 

However, it is important to consider that this approach would require significantly more resources and time for model preparation and training. 

**Recommended Approach:** If historical accuracy and purity of the scientific context are essential, it is preferable to create a new specialized model. If resources are limited, a compromise with fine-tuning may be acceptable, but with an awareness of the potential risks of distortion. 

## Will there be sufficient data to construct adequate intelligence if we limit ourselves to sources from the 17th century?

**Answer:** If we limit ourselves solely to 17th-century sources, there may not be enough data to create a fully-fledged and flexible intelligence, particularly in areas where historical sources are sparse or fragmentary.

Here is the translated text:

---

This may limit agents' abilities to generate new and productive scientific ideas. ## Is it possible to synthesize some data through content moderation, to create and supplement a 17th-century dataset with synthetic data that does not disrupt chronology for complementarity and completeness of data? What could be continuations of this thought or, conversely, its criticism?

**Answer:** Yes, synthesizing additional data that aligns with the knowledge and logic of the era can significantly enhance the completeness and usefulness of the dataset. Possible approaches include:

* **Synthetic scenarios and experiments:** Creating hypothetical but realistic scenarios and experiments that could have been conducted at the time to fill knowledge gaps.  
* **Using generative models:** Automatically generating texts that correspond to historical realities and the stylistics of the era, followed by content moderation.  
* **Historical-scientific reconstruction:** Engaging expert historians to create additional materials accurately reflecting the spirit and level of science at that time.  

**Critique of the approach:** However, it is important to ensure that synthetic data does not distort historical accuracy and does not introduce inappropriate modern concepts. Transparency must also be ensured, allowing differentiation between synthetic data and authentic historical sources.  

**Recommended approach:** A careful combination of genuine historical materials and moderately utilized synthetic data, with mandatory moderation and verification of historical accuracy. 

## What volume of texts is needed to achieve intelligence at the GPT-4 level?

**Answer:** Training a model at the GPT-4 level requires an enormous amount of data, typically on the order of hundreds of billions of tokens of text (approximately tens of terabytes of raw text content). GPT-4 was trained on data covering a large part of the internet, including books, encyclopedias, articles, and other resources. If one limits to historical data from the 17th century exclusively, the volume will be significantly less. With a limited historical dataset, it will require either:

* Substantial supplementation of the dataset with synthetic data appropriate to the era.  
* Use of transfer learning approaches, where the model is first trained on large general data and then carefully fine-tuned on historical data. A full-fledged LLM at the GPT-4 level based solely on historical data will require qualitative and quantitative expansion of the dataset through additional measures and careful content preparation. 

## How long will it take to generate such data? Estimate computational resources and timelines.

**Answer:** Generating data amounting to tens of terabytes, necessary for an LLM at the GPT-4 level, is an extremely resource-intensive task. Approximate benchmarks include:

* **Computational resources:** Significant computational power will be required, on the order of hundreds or even thousands of GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA A100 or H100 types) that must operate in parallel in data centers.  
* **Time costs:** Generating and processing data on the scale of tens of terabytes may take from several months to a year, depending on the availability of computational power and the complexity of the generative processes.  

**Recommended approach:** It is optimal to use cloud computing resources with scalability options, allowing flexible control over timelines and costs. It is also beneficial to apply data optimization and compression methods and to utilize specialized generative models tailored specifically to the era and the type of content.

**Overall Principle:** All instruments should be represented through a minimally realistic model capable of providing the agent with plausible data without revealing the device that they have not yet "discovered." This allows resource savings and maintains historical accuracy. ## And how these tools are distributed around the world. Does the laboratory have any backstory?

## How does the agent come to realize that they are missing a certain tool?
How does the agent come to realize that they are missing a certain tool?
Response:
The agent becomes aware of the lack of a tool during the process of attempting to implement a hypothesis or set up an experiment. The following mechanisms are possible:

1. **Cognitive Bias in Planning**  
Using their model of scientific reasoning, the agent builds a plan that includes steps requiring observation or measurement. If they cannot simulate this step, "goal frustration" arises:  

Hypothesis: “To test this, I need to measure X”;  
The tool that provides X is not in the list of available means;  
The agent notes the gap in the toolset.

2. **Contextual Heuristic**  
While reading previous entries, “correspondences” with other agents, or browsing old logs, the agent may encounter a reference to a device they lack but that solves the current problem.

3. **Underdefined Model**  
If the agent lacks data to assess a parameter (e.g., time, length, mass), and realizes that the uncertainty of the hypothesis is too high, they may conclude that they need a device to measure this variable.

4. **Communication**  
If agents are in networked interaction, through peer-to-peer exchange they can:  

Learn about the existence of new devices;  
Receive a “hint” from another agent: “I solved a similar task using a thermometer.”

5. **Archetypical Images**  
If the simulator supports a mechanism of analogies (similar to how GPT makes analogical inferences), the agent might guess the possibility of creating a similar device for another type by analogy with a tool for one type of measurement:  
“I have a ruler for length… so I can create a time ruler — a clock.”

**Conclusion:**  
This requires the agent's architecture to include a planning module, an inventory of available tools, a goal model, and a representation of the measured variables. Together, these components allow the formation of the thought: “To test this hypothesis, I need to measure something I currently cannot — I need a new tool.”

If you want, I can add this to your Q&A document. 

## Does the agent need any sense of internal experience in such a simulation? For example, Isaac Asimov sometimes went to watch an action-packed movie before writing the next chapter of his science fiction series. Or is this a feature of how the biological brain works, how it builds associations? What plays a similar role in association building in machine learning? Or am I anthropomorphizing too much?

ChatGPT said:  
Does the agent need "internal experience" — emotions, associative impressions, a “movie outing” before the insight?
1. **Why Humans Need This Experience**  
For the human researcher, side impressions (film, walk, music) serve several accelerator functions:  

**Function** | **Cognitive Effect**  
— | —  
Breaking fixed patterns | External information creates new associations, helping to escape the "local minimum of an idea."  
Supplementing raw material for analogies | Unexpected images expand the space of analogies, increasing the chance of insight.  
Emotional regulation | Experiencing a “vibe” maintains motivation and reduces cognitive fatigue.  

2. **What Is Critical for the AI Agent**  
For formal scientific advancement, the agent needs three purely functional abilities — all achievable without the literal simulation of human feelings:  

**Requirement** | **Machine Analogy**  
— | —  
(a) Stochastic associations — to break out of templates | Random shuffling of the hidden state of the LLM, temperature > 1.

Here is the translation of the provided text into English:

0, sampling alternative continuations, diversity sampling
(a) generation of new data combinations "Iterative self-reflection": the agent briefly summarizes the idea, asks itself a clarifying question, incorporates it into the context, and regenerates — ≈ "brainstorming"
(b) internal motivation to seek the unexplained Metrics of novelty/curiosity from RL: the agent is rewarded if it makes a prediction with high error, thereby uncovering a "white spot"

3. What it looks like in the simulator code
```
Agent
 ├─ LLM_core
 │    └─ sampling(temperature, top_p)  ← (a)
 ├─ ReflectionLoop(n_cycles)           ← (b)
 └─ CuriosityReward(o_t, ŷ_t)          ← (c)
```
Without "movie reviews": instead, there is stochastic permuted embedding noise. Without emotions: a scalar internal bonus for novelty or for reducing uncertainty is sufficient. 4. Is there a direct benefit from simulating human emotions?
Argument in favor   Counterargument
Multimodal stimuli can accelerate discovery (analogous to the "insight after a movie"). The same acceleration is achieved by algorithmic "add noise" + "raise temperature" + "run self-reflection". Plausibility, if the simulation is also an educational/play product. In an engineering simulator, the plausibility of behavior is more important than the plausibility of feelings. 5. When are "emotions" still useful?
Educational scenarios: if the goal is to teach people through observation of agents, an emotional response makes them more convincing. Social dynamics of the 17th century: jealousy between schools, fame, patronage. These phenomena can be simplified into rules of reputation without modeling the phenomenological experience. 6. Conclusion
For purely scientific productivity, the agent is sufficient with algorithms for random restarts, a curiosity mechanism, and a self-reflection loop. Biological emotions and random cultural impressions are merely a heuristic for Homo sapiens to achieve the same effects that we can directly specify with a random seed number and the intrinsic reward formula. Therefore, the danger of "excessive anthropomorphism" is real here: it is better to implement functional equivalents than to simulate feelings for the sake of feelings. ## Are modern LLMs capable of proposing new ideas and concepts worthy of Einstein, or is the issue only in scale? ## I think if we prove through the simulator that LLMs can independently reinvent science, rediscover Maxwell's laws, for example, it would be a colossal achievement. ## Critically analyze this idea, find counterarguments. Modern large language models can already surprise us with flashes of genuine problem-solving thinking, but it is still premature to expect "Einstein in silicon" from current architectures. On the optimistic side, GPT-4 class models have demonstrated the ability to independently derive compact physical laws from raw time series, write short symbolic proofs, and iteratively correct code until numerical errors vanish. If such a model is placed in a closed "sandbox," where only texts up to 1860 are available, retrained, and connected to a virtual laboratory, it is possible to organize an automatic cycle of "plan → experiment → error analysis → new hypothesis." With careful engineering, the agent might rediscover mathematically equivalent equations for Maxwell's laws or Kepler's laws without ever seeing their canonical forms. Proving such an "independent reconstruction" would be a significant achievement. Nevertheless, there are four systemic barriers. First, data leakage. The weights of today's models are already infused with modern physics; even after aggressive text filtering, it is difficult to ensure that the machine is not rephrasing memorized correlations. Second, weak "grounding." LLMs predict tokens, not real measurements. Without a dense feedback channel where a wrong voltage prediction "burns" the coil and reduces the reward, the system has little incentive to abandon a beautiful but incorrect story. Third, ontological invariance. Great scientific breakthroughs often required the introduction of fundamentally new concepts — curvature of spacetime, entropy, quantum. Current LLMs excel at combining established concepts but rarely create new fundamental variables on which entire theories can stand. Fourth, verification. Even if the agent produces original equations, humans need to demonstrate that the output is indeed novel and that the theory makes testable predictions outside the training distribution. Scaling up will not remove these barriers by itself. The larger the model, the better it approximates curves, but the leap to a new ontology almost certainly requires architectural additions: a symbolic reasoning module, an internal curiosity signal tied to "wonder" in experiments, and strict isolation from modern knowledge. Credible demonstration should include training only on pre-Maxwell texts, an automatic laboratory with noisy measurements, a self-reflective cycle with rewards for compressed explanations, and "blind" peer review by independent physicists. Thus, in the near future, LLM agents are likely to become catalysts for human researchers: accelerating hypothesis generation, automating conclusions, and scanning the vast combinatorial space that human intuition struggles to explore at a painstakingly slow pace. To become fully autonomous "Einsteins", a different cognitive infrastructure and deeper experimental involvement will be required than currently exists in token predictors. ## Tell me more about Modeling Open-World Cognition; is it applicable to our task?

The concept of Modeling Open-World Cognition as On-Demand Synthesis of Probabilistic Models (MSA) describes a way in which artificial intelligence can be made to dynamically build a "world model on-the-fly" and then reason within it — instead of relying on pre-programmed rules or static schemes.

🧠 What does it mean?
A flexible model for each case.
Agents are not limited to a single model of the world—they form the model they need (for example, for electricity, evolution, or differential calculus) based on the current query. Probabilistic Programming + LLM.
The model construction is carried out through probabilistic programming. LLM helps create the necessary structure (for example, "why does a frog jump when electric current is applied?")—and then within this model, the agent makes inferences. Expanding reasoning.
The agent first synthesizes an appropriate model and then conducts analysis within it. This is much more flexible than following a single rigid reasoning module. Verified in open-world tasks.
Research has shown that this approach is more effective in handling the "open world," where it is unknown which variables and connections are important.
arXiv. ✅ How this applies to our task.
Our task	How MSA helps
We don’t know in advance what facts are needed for the initial theories.	The agent synthesizes the model itself (for example, about forces, charges, flight).
Hypotheses need to be tested in a virtual environment.	MSA provides a flexible framework—first the model, then reasoning.
It is necessary to handle unpredictable discoveries.	MSA operates in an open-world context, where the agent builds models “on demand.”

In summary: **MSA is a mechanism that allows our agents not only to "read" the simulated culture but also to generate their own cognitive models, conduct virtual experiments within them, and draw conclusions. 🧩 Recommendations for implementation:
Integrate probabilistic programming (e.g., Pyro) together with LLM-guided model synthesis. Use such dynamic models within virtual experiments: the agent first synthesizes the world model → requests us to calculate the results → evaluates within that model. This approach will give agents autonomy in conceptualization, rather than requiring prior knowledge of analytical types.
