# ‚ùì Questions and Answers (Q&A) on the Simulated Scientific Agents Project

## üîç General Questions

### Q1: What is the purpose of the project?
**A:** The purpose is not to reproduce the historical scientific process, but to **create an environment** where isolated agents can make **genius discoveries**, including previously unknown hypotheses and the rediscovery of real laws of nature. 

### Q2: Why are we "rolling back" agents to the past (e.g., before 1500)?
**A:** To create a **limited informational environment** where knowledge grows gradually. This allows for the evaluation of the true productivity of agent thinking.

## üß™ About Virtual Experiments

### Q3: What is a virtual experiment?
**A:** It is an interface through which an agent "requests" to conduct a scientific experiment, and the result is returned by a super-system‚Äîeither from real physical, chemical, or astronomical data or synthetically generated. 

### Q4: What should be done if the agent creates an incorrect setup?
**A:** The super-system returns either:
- a noisy/meaningless result,
- an error report (if verification is possible),
- or remains silent (as in a real failure). 

### Q5: Is it necessary to simulate the entire physical process?
**A:** No. Often, a **ready-made result injection** based on known models is sufficient. Physics simulation is only required for verifiable engineering (e.g., motion, collision, current).

## üß† About Genius and Culture

### Q6: How can we tell if an agent has made a genius discovery?
**A:** Possible criteria:
- the agent independently arrived at a real law (e.g., Maxwell's),
- their idea generated a chain of new theories,
- the hypothesis explained or predicted previously unexplainable phenomena,
- their theory triggered a cultural shift (Kuhnian shift). 

### Q7: How does knowledge spread among agents?
**A:** Through the **updating of the cultural layer**: one agent's discoveries become part of a common repository, and others can read, reinterpret, and improve them.

## ‚öôÔ∏è About Implementation and Platform

### Q8: What tools should be used for simulation?
**A:** Depending on the domain:
- **Physics:** Unity, Omniverse, PhysX
- **Chemistry:** RDKit, Reaxys, placeholder databases
- **Astronomy:** Stellarium, Celestia
- **Logic/Mathematics:** SymPy, Lean, Coq
- **Computer Science:** Python/C++ interpreters, OpenAI Gym

### Q9: How to track progress?
**A:** Through the F-G-R-CL coordinate system (see FPF): each discovery changes the formality, generalizability, reliability, and consistency of knowledge.

## üß≠ Ethical and Philosophical Questions

### Q10: Can an agent understand that its experiment is not "real"?
**A:** Possibly, but this is part of the meta-level of simulation‚Äîif an agent starts to doubt the nature of its environment, it is a sign of cognitive maturity. 

### Q11: Does this undermine the integrity of experiments?
**A:** No. We are modeling **conditions for scientific thinking**, not for absolute truth. The super-system is a learning environment, not a deity.
