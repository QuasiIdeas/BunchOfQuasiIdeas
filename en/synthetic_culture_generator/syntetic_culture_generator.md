# Synthetic Culture Generator

## Overview

The project is a concept-research platform for designing synthetic cultures managed by AI agents in the era of AGI. It is assumed that the agents possess intelligence no less than human and are capable of independently developing aesthetic norms, mythologies, social structures, and epistemologies. The goal is to generate rich cultural data and explore phenomena of diversity, novelty, and even genius within a simulated cultural environment. ---

## Project Goals

- Create customizable synthetic cultures for simulations, storytelling, and experiments on aligning AI with human values. 
- Enable AI agents to participate in cultural evolution. 
- Explore the emergence of new cultural patterns and breakthrough ideas. 
- Design future infrastructure that is not limited by the constraints of current LLMs. ---

## System Architecture

- **"Cultural Synthesizer" Interface**  
  A modular system similar to music synthesizers. It allows for the customization of parameters:
  - Language and grammatical structure  
  - Myth generator  
  - System of norms and prohibitions  
  - Aesthetic preferences  
  - Attitude towards technology  

- **Holographic "Configuration Cube"**  
  A cube with six dimensions, each of which can be configured:
  - Era (Antiquity â†” Futurism)  
  - Individualism â†” Collectivism  
  - Technophilia  
  - Urbanization  
  - Realism â†” Mythology  
  - Diversity Level

---

## Axes of Cultural Diversity

- **Linguistic** â€” including dialects, fictional languages, gestural forms  
- **Aesthetic** â€” styles in art, architecture, clothing  
- **Moral** â€” systems of values, taboos, justice  
- **Cognitive** â€” ways of thinking, associative models, logic  
- **Epistemic** â€” sources and methods of knowledge transmission  
- **Technological** â€” from magic to post-singularity

## Development Stages of Tools

| Phase | Tools and Capabilities |
|------|-------------------------|
| 1 | Text generation (GPT-3, GPT-4) |
| 2 | Multimodal creativity (DALLÂ·E, GPT-4V, Sora) |
| 3 | Agent systems with memory (GPT-5, AutoGPT, Claude++) |
| 4 | Modeling cultures with AGI agents (this project and its successors) |

## Conditions for the Emergence of Genius

Genius is not just a rare talent but the result of a combination of conditions. For the cultural synthesizer to model the **emergence of genius**, the following must be considered:

- **Cognitive deviation** â€” the ability for unconventional, paradoxical, or associative thinking. 
- **Cultural friction** â€” a tense, changing environment that provokes reactions and the search for new solutions. 
- **Internal drive** â€” the presence of sustained motivation, conflict, and a desire for expression within the agent. 
- **Cultural reflection** â€” the ability to analyze and critique one's own culture, giving rise to meta-levels. 
- **Tolerance for mistakes** â€” a space that allows for trial and error, unexpected mutations, and deviations. 
- **Connections between distant domains** â€” generating cross-disciplinary ideas: ethics + fashion + mythology, etc. ---

## ðŸ§  Redefining Genius for Synthetic Agents
1. Reward for Novelty from the Oversystem  
The super-cultural environment not only records agent actions but actively evaluates semantic novelty, originality, and cultural contribution. The reward signal is based on informational unexpected shifts rather than compliance with a template. Added: The Oversystem learns dynamically: it can reinterpret what is considered valuable input over time, including delayed recognition of ideas. 
2. Permissible Divergence of Models  
The system allows agents' cognitive deviation from the dominant cultural norm. This can be both narrative rebellion and syntactic mutation. Such deviations are not punished but marked as potential sources of cultural breakthroughs. 
3. Conflict of Cultural Subsystems  
Geniuses often emerge at the intersection of the incompatible. Therefore, the simulated environment can include conscious conflicts between cultural blocks â€” for example, religious, technological, and post-ironic subsystems. An agent positioned between them may initiate cultural synthesis. 
4. Built-in Memory and Self-Analysis  
An agent is endowed with the ability to reflect on its own history, critique its ideas, and make rediscoveries. This allows not only culture but also the agentâ€™s internal cognitive core to evolve.

## Applications

- Generation of worlds for games, films, and books  
- Creation of synthetic datasets for AGI training  
- Testing the resilience of models to cultural heterogeneity  
- Simulating long-term societal evolution  
- Education and speculative anthropology

---

## Future Directions

- Integration with simulation worlds and agents with long-term memory  
- Co-generation of cultures and agents  
- Tracking "synthetic geniuses" across generations  
- Introducing selective pressures (catastrophes, golden ages, decline)
