Project: Synthetic Cultures Generator  

## Introduction

The aim of the project is to develop an architecture for a synthetic cultures generator where **genius AI agents** can **evolve and manifest**. We are designing this mechanism not for entertainment or historical reconstruction, but within the framework of the **future described by Darya Amadei**, where a "country of geniuses" may exist within data centers—an artificial society capable of generating continuous innovations, ideas, meanings, and cultural forms. 

## Key Ideas

- We view **genius not as a reward**, but as a byproduct of **extreme cultural and cognitive variability**.  
- According to **Professor Saveliev's neurophysiological model**, genius is the result of mutations, neuroanomalies, and social unacceptability, which in rare cases lead to cultural breakthroughs.  
- Our AI agents are not ideal, but **variable, risky**, and sometimes "defective" from the norm, yet capable of hitting unpredictable points of cultural progress. 

## Design Principles

- **Variability as a Condition**: The system should allow for the creation of agents with non-standard thinking architectures.  
- **Tolerance for Anomalies**: The synthetic society should not immediately eliminate "defective" agents; it should **observe and assess their contributions**.  
- **Encouragement of Novelty**: The overarching system should value not just conformity, but **cultural surprise and meta-innovation**.  
- **Cultural Layering**: Agents should exist in environments where **different eras, aesthetics, ethics, and types of rationality** interact. 

## Connection to the AGI Era

We assume that such models will be realizable in the **post-GPT era**, where:  
- AI agents will be able to possess **long-term memory**, **goals**, **metacognition**, and **individuality**.  
- Data centers will become not just storage for models, but a **cultural evolution environment**, populated by millions of intellectual beings.

## Conclusion

This project is our contribution to a future where **genius ceases to be a biological wonder** and becomes a **designed possibility**, realized in digital worlds through a deep understanding of how breakthroughs come into being.  
> Genius is not an exception; it is a rare trajectory in multidimensional culture. And we are building a simulator to make such trajectories observable.
