Purpose of a software: educational enough to teach poor kids in Bangladesh laws of quantum mechanics

The project has zero budget and is supported enthusiastically only by me and my parents.
I hope to get some advice and ideas from professionals in this field, perhaps technical advice

In the project ballpark there is a maze and some agent going thru the maze.
Demonstrate many possible paths that agent can have. 
But in the moment of decoherence all quantum realities are disappear and we how only one trajectory 
and only one agent doing measurements and so on.

The software  have thow main modes: classical and quantum mechanical. With big button or toggle below the play button (if we mean Unity game engine) 

The scene should demonstrate the principle of Everettâ€™s quantum parallel universes for examples of a robot car going through a maze
We need a shader function that makes car particles collect or scatter. It is also necessary to propagate copies of the car appearing out of nowhere in different parts of the maze. Using vertex shaders and integration of particle trajectories.

# More general idea is to create some classical simulator of a quantum world there 
student can use his own tools to set up an experiment (like the famous double slit experiment). Photon detectors, oscilloscopes, lazers, coils, calorimeters, 
Also the simulator can contain some classical physics lab toys, such as mathematical pendulums. Maybe something to show how the laws of general relativity works (famous Einstein thought experiment with train).

Also we need to simulate classical Turing machine in that lab environment. Examples can be found here https://turingmachinesimulator.com/shared/hrtjbntayc Main idea is to grow initial seed of knowledge in the brain of young physicist or computer scientist about quantum mechanics and how this laws related to computation in general.
