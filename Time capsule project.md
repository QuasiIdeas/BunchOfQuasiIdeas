# Time capsule

Baranov Vladimir vsbaranov83@gmail.com <br/>
Creation date: April 5, 2021

Project goal: Overcome the Great Filter. To develop a device capable of teaching future generations living after an existential catastrophe some of our technologies or the technologies of the ancients.
Ensure the safety of the device underground for a period of more than 100 years. It is possible to launch such a capsule into space at speeds approaching the speed of light with a return back. The sizes of underground capsules can vary up to the sizes of bunkers.
This technology will allow you to get into a certain cycle of time and not commit suicide for an entire civilization.
Arrange an international competition for the best device.
Responsibility for the catastrophe lies equally with the countries of the block of the USSR and the USA.
Since we have created satellite, nuclear weapons, they have created internet AI and so on. etc.
All this was done in response to our actions and vice versa.
Even if the Chinese are to blame for this particular pandemic, then for future disasters, perhaps part of the blame will fall on our country.
Well, what's done is done. We must accept the state of reality in which we are at this point in time.

### Rationale.
Humanity may not survive the 21st century with a 50/50 chance, writes Martin Rees.
But the plans of transhumanists are designed for a longer period. Even if we don't create our latest agi invention more powerful than a human by 2045 as Ray Kurzweil predicted - we may die from one of the existential risks (pandemic, nuclear war).
If this happens, then the population will drop sharply, for example, with the onset of nuclear winter.
Some fractions of a percent will survive in different places on the Earth.
In thousands, and maybe even millions of years, the biosphere will recover, and the agrarian phase of civilization will begin.
Already at this stage, information from the time capsule can greatly accelerate the technological progress of the society of the future.
Accelerate the onset of the industrial phase.

# Problems
* The main problem: how to make the project profitable?
* How to make chips that live much longer than modern ones?

# Questions
* How to restart civilization in a short time?
* How to collect data on ancient technologies in a short time?
* How to make a training video understandable to an uncivilized person?
* How to teach the scientific method to someone with a medieval or savage mindset?
* How to start a car engine using wood instead of gasoline?
* How to reconstruct the calendar from an arbitrary point in the future? Know the exact date?
* How to make paper from scratch and your own ink?
* How to make a printing press?
* How to make a wood or metal lathe using fewer modern tools?

### Capsule hardware requirements
  It is necessary that the microchips of the device be designed for a period of more than 30 years.
Modern systems such as smartphones and home computers are designed for the consumer society.
In which it is considered normal to change the gadget every 3 years.<br> In the case of computers, this period is no more than 20 years.
The GPS system is tied to ground signals for synchronization and clocks. Therefore, gps navigation will not live long.
The device needs chips that last much longer than modern ones. <br>
It is necessary to ensure the safety of microcircuits, protect them from corrosion by maintaining a constant temperature, pressure,
perhaps a vacuum, or at least a hermetic shell.<br>
The prototype of the device can be made on the basis of an e-ink book with a solar battery connected.
The memory of such an electronic book can contain thousands of the most important books for civilization.
The problem of knowing the videos contained in zettabytes stored on youtube-like services.
A book with e-ink can "read" a video if it is converted into asci codes.
see Python program [ASCII-art-PIXEL-art](https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/ASCII-art-PIXEL-art)

**Built-in intelligence** Hardware support for reinforcement learning <br>
**Power supply:** solar panels, nuclear battery. <br>
**Triggers for powering the circuit (watchdog):** by atomic clock on a certain date, mechanical triggers by opening event are possible.<br>
The presence of a radio beacon in the capsule. <br>
**Network support:** Each pod must have its own unique IP address and be able to communicate with other pods over the air
<br>

# Communication time capsules with a base on Mars.
A future option is possible in which the base on Mars will exist, and there will be no civilization on Earth.
Then the dissemination of information to Mars that there is still someone left on Earth will cause feedback in 4-d space.

# The revival of filmstrip technology
By using the new synthetic media technology, it is possible to create Soviet films with other faces.
In each new capsule, you can change the faces of the characters. For example, instead of Hypolite, put Monroe. Create a filmstrip from these GAN-updated films. And put in a capsule.

### Fool-proof adjusted for average iq
   On the capsule, you need to do some kind of access control with an intelligence test.
To keep it from falling into the wrong hands. Those. without passing the test, a hard lock is enabled so that it cannot be dismantled, an anti-vandal case, etc. For example, a peasant can throw out or damage the main device and it will not get to the leader of the tribe.
In general, it is quite scientific to assume that the average intelligence of people in a sample 1000 times smaller than the modern one will be less.
Although the deviation from the mean may be greater than if you have 7 billion. population.
It is also impossible to discard the possibility that the result of unplanned mutations from the background radiation
will be the deterioration of cognitive abilities, which will be inherited for many generations to come.
Considering the worst-case scenario, the intelligence test should not be very difficult.

### What information should be included in the capsule?
   It is necessary to represent all knowledge in symbolic form.
In the form of pictures, video (animated gifs). The device must contain a learning program for learning English.
At the first stage, basic information is collected from electronic encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. In books on engineering and construction.
If you just print Wikipedia and put it in a capsule, there is a high probability that the savages of the future will burn it or use it to heat the body or something else and important information, precious knowledge will be lost. Therefore, it is important to reserve, the more time capsules, the better.
   It is necessary to restore the lost technologies, for example, those that the Vikings used in construction
boats (dracars) made of stone nails and stone tools. This knowledge is passed down from master to master through generations, and, surprisingly, they do not have Wikipedia pages. Another problem is that knowledge about how modern civilization works is distributed among a huge number of highly specialized people. For example, it takes at least 1,000 people to produce an ordinary pencil. None of these people know all the details of how a pencil is made in a factory.

So-called "3rd world technologies" will fit here, for example, a pumping station based on a bicycle.
Knowledge must be presented with an adjustment for the fact that the average iq will most likely be lower than the modern one.
Therefore, the device should automatically select the material corresponding to the level of the user.

# Contents of the capsule:
* Mechanical models of various devices in miniature printed on a 3D printer.
* A musical instrument like a miniature hurdy-gurdy with drawings by Escher
* abacus, mechanical calculators
* Some model of an electric motor and training models demonstrating the physical principles of electromagnetism (Faraday, Maxwell)
* Mechanical engineering: engines, transmission, generators, windmills, [water wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_wheel), etc.
* [mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windmill)
* Microfilms and a microscope for viewing them with an illustration of how to change microfilms.
* Maps
*WMAP
* cryopreserved brains :)

## List of technologies for compiling a training program
0. How to make fire and why fire is needed.
1. How to cook food on fire
2. How to make a windmill
3. How to plant wheat and process seeds in a mill
4. A simple water disinfection method. Leave the plastic bottle in the sun.
5. The rule that you can't throw your excrement into the river from which they take water.
6. Production of weapons
7. How to make a glass lens (https://youtu.be/2SJY0foypAo)

## List of tools.
With instructions on how to make the tool. Testing Required
1. Simple stone tools (stone nails, hammers)
2. Tools for processing wood, stone, metal
3. Glass production (lenses, flasks for chemical reactions)
3. Medical instruments
4. Agricultural tools
5. Navigational instruments

## Mini Time Capsule
A mini time capsule with some kind of content, such as paper, can be made from a plastic bottle. Plastic has been around for over 500 years. Pack paper with the contents of a document or a message into the future in polyethylene. Thus. A flexible plastic bag is placed in a plastic bottle. Fold the paper from the notebook into a box in strips and gradually lower it into the bottle. The stripes will fill the space of the bottle. Optional: Make an origami in the form of a frog, a fish or a boat. Leave room for the stones. Throw the bottle into the sea, ocean or any nearby pond.

### Calculation of the number of time capsules depending on the number of people and their distribution over the surface

For the example of Africa
Area 30,221,532 km² <br/>
Population 1.3 billion (2020)<br/>
Density 30.51 people/km² <br/>
The length of the coastline of the African continent is 30,500 km. <br>
If the population of Africa is 1.3 million, which corresponds to 3000 BC. e.
then the population density will be 0.0430156 <br>
This is one person for every 33 km. <br>
If the area of ​​the capsule is 30 m², then the probability of finding it will be 1.5e-02 <br>
In 10,000 years, this will increase the chances by N times and will be 100% <br>
Total: 3 thousand capsules <br>
With a construction speed of 19 days, the project could be completed in 89 years

# Site apocalyptoLIB
Project goal: Overcome the Great Filter. To develop a device capable of teaching future generations living after an existential catastrophe some of our technologies or the technologies of the ancients.

The apocalyptoLIB site is a continuation of the Time Capsule device project, which in turn was described in my story "Excavations of the Ancients"

Site purpose.
To provide for the use and compilation of the inhabitants of the planet Earth an electronic library with themes related to the reorganization of civilization
after the global collapse and under resource constraints.
Books should be aimed at the average person without much special knowledge or highly developed skills.
Moreover, it is rational to count the complexity of materials even on a lower level of intelligence than people who wrote books in the 20th century.
The selected materials should be discussed on the forum and gain conditional likes.
The forum should also be in the form of a zoom or discord conference with the ability to discuss materials online as long as there is a connection.
If communication is not possible, you can always switch to the telegraph and radio relay networks.
Each library material will have a forum thread with a discussion.
The most difficult task for the scientific community is to prioritize.
Of the 8 million books from the largest electronic library z-lib.org or any other (even from Leninka) to select the most important for restarting civilization after the collapse.

Languages: English, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, German, Spanish and more

Platform and technologies: google cloud + webgl

Rationale for platform choice:
1. I have experience only in this web platform
2. Only Google will survive the apocalypse

# Charismatic leader, propagandist and podcaster
Any community always revolves around some bright personality.
The project needs a charismatic propagandist like Andrei Karaulov or Mike Adams.
It is desirable that he be not only a journalist, but also a talented programmer or engineer.

He had a degree, etc., etc. People love to reach out to authority figures.
Imitators, envious people and people supporting the leader appear. It is necessary that the library's ideas about what to get away from the consumer society
towards the creation of something like the medieval guilds of craftsmen or the Amish. Communities living in the most autonomous way, for example, with minimal dependence on the mains.

On the other hand, his podcasts should not have a lot of politics, or rather, it should be reduced to a minimum.
The main message that the propagandist should convey is the importance of acquiring the skills necessary for survival after an existential catastrophe.
It should support the most horizontal communities and the free exchange of knowledge in them.
We focus on generation Z, which, according to statistics, wants to live as independently as possible, to do something with their own hands.

A person who plays the role of a propagandist due to the specifics of digital platforms such as youtube or spotify
Should regularly emphasize the importance of projects like apocaliptoiLIB and the time capsule for prosperity or just simple survival
humanity in the future. We need to remind people all the time about the importance of manual labor, the importance of knowledge or know-how.
about how to do something useful with your own hands.

Personally, I don't fit into this role. My role is to work out the general concept of the entire project, develop it-infrastructure, attract smart people to the site, collect ideas and know-how from the Internet and embed into the general knowledge tree as done in the book [2].
In the elaboration of the holistic concept of science and technology, which opposes the reductionist perception of the world.
At the same time, I try to work on small details.
# What kind of people will be in demand in the project

All groups can be combined into two large groups: a test group and a group of scientists.
The test group is a model group of people with virtually zero experience in tool building.
The task of scientists is to develop the most intelligent learning device with a large knowledge base.
Something similar can be found in famous television shows where a group of people on a desert island cope with life's difficulties.
Ideally, you need to allocate the territory of a small country for such experiments.

1. Archaeologists and engineers rolled into one. Recreation of the technologies of ancient Rome, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance.
2. Geologists familiar with climate models to plan where to establish new settlements.
3. People who know the history of technology well. Collecting and compiling information about the knowledge generated from the work of archaeologists and engineers.
4. Builders working with traditional techniques.
5. Campers that know how to survive in the wild
6. Podcasters, propagandists for promotion
7. Surgeons for surgical operations
8. Doctors with knowledge about herbal treatment with a minimum of pharma
   and preferably those who practice treatment without pharmaceutical drugs
7. Engineers working in the field of designing mechanical machines from wood
8. Engineers with experience in creating any machines and tools from scratch
9. Psychologists for work in the community. Development of EQ, for example, the ability to cope with stress during a lack of electricity or problems with food.
10. People with experience in cattle breeding and farm work
11. Geoengineers who are able to plan a new settlement in an arbitrary place without the use of gps, GIS, etc.
    It is not even necessary to know how to connect to logistics networks, it is enough to be able to draw a diagram on the map.
    

14. Chemists to simplify chemical processes and simplify production chains.
16. Any people who are not indifferent to the idea and ready to work as volunteers
18. Communication engineers are needed, at the first stages, starlink will provide the Internet from anywhere in the world to support the first settlements.
    In subsequent years, the Starlink's umbilical cord should preferably be removed.
    
    


# Statistics.
Currently in apocalyptoLIB: 85 books

# Feedback. Critical maximum scientific analysis of materials of the survival library.
Arrange crowdfunding or at least feedback
so that users can communicate and upload their books to the library.
It is desirable to develop the skills of critical thinking and book analysis, which is not very characteristic even among scientists with doctoral degrees.

# The first stage of development on the free web platform Google Apps.
You can use pasture which is kindly provided by the corporation. 15 GB per disk space account. This is quite enough to ensure the discussion of all the ones I need by that scientific community for several years. It is possible that every inhabitant of the planet Earth may want to allocate at least 0.01% of their disk for good purposes.

I have a razor vest in my dacha with the name Occam glued on it. When I shave, I always remember his famous principle, do not produce essence beyond what is necessary. Instead of renting a virtual machine in the first step, I implement the minimal functionality of a forum with support for tags based on a Google web application .gs script.
The web application will be stored and run from google drive on one of the huge number of google servers.
There will be no registration on the forum, aka complete anarchy. 3 fields: Name, subject, text

Restriction on the maximum length of the post. More than twitter.
Max. number of posts per day from one IP
You can make some kind of protection against primitive bots such as captcha

Smart people that I need on the site like to work for money. The first who will come to the site will most likely be narrow-minded inhabitants or, even worse, trolls. I still have no way to pay for the work of fat admins who do not monkey but repetitive work for 90 thousand a month. When I tried to rent a virtual machine on Google, I ran into a problem with Russian savings banks. Google does not accept my debit card, and moreover, the Qiwi platform in the form of a virtual card also sucks. When Wonky was bankrupt he had to mortgage his house. I don’t have the opportunity to rent a full-fledged server from Google now. I don't even have a formal job.

# The second stage of development. The principle of holography.
In apocalyptoLIB, you need to do something like the neuroevolution of posts,
so that information is holographically distributed across all Google drives.
If one Google drive falls off, you will get something like this.

original_text = "The chords sounded smooth and nondissonant but textange and somewhat eerie. The effect was so different
from the tempered scale that there was no tendency to judge in-tuneness or out-of-tuneness. It seemed like a
peek into a new and unfamiliar musical world, in which none of the old rules applied, and the new ones, if any, were undiscovered. F. H. Slaymaker [B: 176]"

survived_text = "The cogrds sotnsed smooth and nondpssonant but toxedoge and sommwfat eerie. The ecfect was so diugerent from tde temmered scale tnat thtre was no tendgncy to judge it-tuncnkss or oum-oq-tuneresu. It senmed like a peek into a ngw and ucfumiliar mhsical wotld, in which none of the old rules applird, and the new onbs, if aey, were unkiscovered. F. H. Slaymafer [l: 176]"

Accordingly, with pictures from books (jpeg files), you need to do something like that, since you can skip pixels there, or rather DCT blocks. Or reduce the number of quantization levels of the DCT coefficients. In my other QuasiCode project, I will try to record arbitrary information inside a regular h264 video that can be distributed via youtube and the torrent network. This will work like teletext in the old television, but with more bandwidth. QuasiCode must be resistant to video compression.

If I may say so, it is called a decentralized anonymized holographic
database necessary for the survival of civilization.
Information recovery is possible both with the help of people and robots.
If a post is liked, as it is done in stackoverflow, more copies of it are made and bytes of this post survive.
Thus, only useful information remains in the cloud.
The rest of the posts eventually turn into an absolutely chaotic set of characters.
We hope that there will be friendly robots in the context of the entire text or discussion threads on the forum will restore the original text.

## Criteria for assessing the success of the project
If a certain percentage of smart people with a suitable education come to the site and are ready to cooperate within the framework of the apocalypto, either I will consider this the first victory. Next, we organize a conference on a freenet, bastion, or other decentralized p2p network (discord, according to the source https://digdeeper.neocities.org/, collects information about the phone and does other dirty tricks). I repeat once again that the task is not trivial, requiring a separate direction in research - restarting civilization after a collapse. Here you need to compile the knowledge about how the whole civilization works, something like Lewis Dartnell did (The knowledge how to rebuild our world from scratch) and retrain many people. Recycle books, recreate old technologies and entire industries. Organize autonomous medieval guilds living almost without electricity. To study these communities living outside the big cities for at least a few years in terms of psychology, how people will adapt. This is a very large scientific and engineering work. If we do not want to suddenly find ourselves with a broken trough, we must start today. It will be necessary to create new products and, like engineers developing a product for the mass market, test them "in the wild." Find flaws, fix documentation, republish books.


## Moderation system
There will be anarchy in the world of the apocalypse. This means no state apparatus or police. No one can protect you if you are weak and cannot protect yourself. The advantage of democracy and deanonymization is that you can assign conditional authority to participants in scientific discourse. But in principle, this will be clear at the level of post likes. That is, ideally, even a developer or a so-called system administrator cannot remove information from the network. Once you have lost your post id (16 digit post number) you have lost the ability to remove information from the hologram. No one can delete your post, not even the network administrator. The only thing they can do is block access to everyone who has allocated space on Google Drive, and only Google can do this, and then through long lawsuits. In this case, the entire library will fall at once. We all remember the day when mickey mouse and all his posts were unfairly removed from twitter.

## Features
Like book, like post, dislike post. In short, the idea is to implement stackoverflow specifically for apocaliptoLIB The forum is organized in the form of questions with voting for the best solutions. You can also see how quora, stackexchange, mail.ru questions are implemented. Maybe you can embed questions from the quora platform inside your site. But the main idea of ​​the forum is a critical analysis of library materials. Then there is the organization of tours, a community of surfers, etc. Around this, you can advertise all sorts of products for survivalists.

# Library design.
The library should provide access to the book directly online.
Button to take a book / give a book
If the user wishes, if he reads a long disclaimer
and agree to all the conditions, he will receive a link to direct access to the pdf-scan of the book.

Original books are on the largest electronic library z-lib.org
The book content viewer is made with special effects.
In places of vital information such as how to disinfect water or how to make a fire
applied motion blur with varying degrees of blur.
To disable the effect, read the long copyright disclaimer and solve a simple puzzle.
(Tetravex, tic tac toe, water or electrical circuit type puzzle)

You can make something like a virtual 3D library with a spiral staircase.
The user can navigate like in a real library and select books.
At this stage, it is planned to connect all the powerful powers of web gl scriptkidi

# Main categories.

* Mechanical engineering: engines, transmission, generators, wind turbines, water wheel, etc. mills
* Printing press
* Abacus, mechanical calculators, prototype computers
* Making tools from wood. Tool making (woodworking)
* Manufacture of metal tools. Lathe.
* Lenses for telescopes and microscopes
* Wood processing in ancient times. woodworking in ancient world

# Purpose of scripts.
| Title | Description |
| --- | --- |
| pages_preview.py | The script bypasses the project tree, selects pdf, epub files and saves individual pages of these documents in jpeg format in the images directory to directories with latinized names. For example, images/{transliterated_filename.pdf} |
| make_list.py | bypasses the catalog of the electronic library, creates a list of pdf and epub documents |
