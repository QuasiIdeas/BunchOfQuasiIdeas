Sure! Here’s the translation of the provided text into English:

##### You said:

"They can't. Well, yes, but there isn't really a brain there, but in fact calculations can also be performed, and those structures don't necessarily have to be neurons, but also cells. For example, Levin talks about this, Michael Levin, he is actually developing this idea."

00:17

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, Michael Levin has the idea that cells can perform computations and process information. He explores how cellular structures can make decisions, similar to how neurons do. This expands our understanding of communication and computation in biology. 

##### You said:

"Be skeptical, bring counter-arguments to what I'm saying, okay?"

00:05

###### ChatGPT said:

Of course! For example, skeptics might point out that while cells perform certain functions, comparing their computational abilities to those of neurons is quite a simplification. Consciousness and cognitive processes involve a vast number of interconnected neurons, which is difficult to replicate at the cellular level. 

##### You said:

"In the end, we will be able to unite somehow, enhance brain capabilities, for example, through electronic neurons, electronic cells directly connected to the nervous system. This is possible."

00:16

###### ChatGPT said:

This is quite likely! Technologies such as neural implants already allow for the enhancement of certain brain capabilities. Over time, even more advanced interfaces for direct interaction with the neural system may emerge. This will open new opportunities for expanding cognitive functions. 

##### You said:

"Well, yes, but what functions could be improved? For example, Bruce Willis, who, by the way, suffers from dementia. And what's wrong with Bruce Willis, by the way?"

00:13

###### ChatGPT said:

Bruce Willis has been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. This is a form of dementia that affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, impacting behavior, personality, and language abilities. Improving cognitive functions through technology in the future could help such patients, for example, in maintaining memory or speech skills. 

##### You said:

"Could this help Bruce Willis? What do you think, is Elon Musk developing this neurotech? There are chips, right? Neurochips. Could they help in cases of dementia or not?"

00:11

###### ChatGPT said:

Neural implants like Neuralink could potentially help in the future. Currently, they are mainly researched for restoring lost functions, such as controlling prosthetics or treating neurological disorders. In the case of dementia, it is still more of a prospect, but research is ongoing, and new methods of assistance may emerge over time. 

##### You said:

##### You said:

"Can you tell me more about this? How does it do it, layering these layers? For example, I start with some basic image, and then how does it add elements, like grass or something else?"

00:15

###### ChatGPT said:

Gemini 2.0 Flash uses a layered approach to image creation. You provide a text description, and based on that, it creates a base layer. Then you add details, and the model overlays new layers, taking into account perspective, light, and textures. All of this is made possible by advanced image generation and synthesis algorithms. ##### You said:

"Well, yeah, it uses something like StableDiffusion, right? Does it use something like StableDiffusion? Or something else? Or a Transformer?"

00:09

###### ChatGPT said:

Gemini 2.0 Flash uses a combination of different technologies, including transformers. Stable Diffusion is one model for generating images, but Gemini may use its own algorithms and architectures to work with text and images. ##### You said:

"Well, does it make moving images at all? For example, I created one image, and then I want to render some frames. Or does it only work with separate pictures?"

00:11

###### ChatGPT said:

Gemini 2.0 Flash primarily works with individual static images. Other tools are generally used for animation, but it's quite possible that similar features will appear in the future. For now, it's better to use specialized programs for creating frames. ##### You said:

"I even uploaded my picture and asked to erase the baseball cap. You can do that. For example, how does it edit photos? Like, I uploaded myself and said, 'erase the baseball cap.'"

00:18

###### ChatGPT said:

To edit photos, Gemini 2.0 Flash uses advanced image processing algorithms. When you upload a photo and give a command, like to remove the baseball cap, the model analyzes the image, identifies the object, and "fills it in" using information from the surrounding pixels. This allows for realistic editing. ##### You said:

"All right, you need to..."

00:01

I completely agree! AI makes technology more accessible and allows people with various skills to engage in creativity, experiment, and find new hobbies. ##### You said:

“What programs can you recommend to create animated films with Artificial Intelligence? I started to learn 3D Studio Max. It's a pretty complex program. How to make a polygonal grid? We made several experimental films when I was still a student. They didn't have much success, but it was interesting.”

00:30

###### ChatGPT said:

If you’re interested in AI animation, you can try programs like Blender, which has become more user-friendly. There’s also Adobe Character Animator, where you can animate characters using a webcam. Additionally, it’s worth looking into Toon Boom Harmony, a professional tool for 2D animation. ##### You said:

“This 2D animation tool also kind of includes generative artificial intelligence.”

00:10

###### ChatGPT said:

Toon Boom Harmony is primarily focused on traditional 2D animation, but some functions can be automated using AI. If you're specifically interested in generative AI, you might want to check out more specialized programs, like Adobe After Effects with plugins or Houdini. ##### You said:

“Is Houdini an old program, I think, for 3D, right?”

00:04

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, Houdini is a powerful 3D program, especially in VFX and procedural graphics. It’s often used for complex simulations and visual effects. Although it’s not new, its functionality is constantly updated, and it remains in demand in the industry. ##### You said:

“What functionality does it have? Is a polygonal grid also used there in some way?”

00:05

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, Houdini actively uses polygonal grids, but its strength lies in a procedural approach. This allows for creating complex models and animations using nodes and scripts, which provides immense flexibility for creating various effects.”

Sure! Here's the translated text:

##### You said:

"What effects can be created with GoodDini?"

00:02

###### ChatGPT said:

With Houdini, you can create complex visual effects such as explosions, liquids, smoke, destruction, as well as procedural modeling of landscapes, buildings, and other objects. It's a versatile tool for creating effects in films and games. 

##### You said:

"So you can even lay internal communications in a building."

00:05

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, you can! With procedural modeling, you can create complex structures, including communications within buildings. Houdini allows you to detail such elements, which is useful for architectural visualization and other projects. 

##### You said:

"Okay, I'll try to see what's available on YouTube about Houdini."

00:05

###### ChatGPT said:

Great idea! There are many educational videos on Houdini on YouTube. I'm sure you'll find something useful and inspiring. 

##### You said:

"And when did it start being developed?"

00:02

###### ChatGPT said:

Houdini began to be developed by SideFX in 1996. Since then, it has significantly evolved and has become one of the leading programs for 3D graphics, especially in the field of visual effects. 

##### You said:

"But I see there are some particles, so the water is simulated, right? Good, it's a powerful system."

00:08

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, Houdini is renowned for its realistic simulations, including particles, liquids, fire, and much more. This makes it indispensable for creating complex effects in films and games. 

##### You said:

"And is this graphics, say, the liquid simulated in real time?"

00:08

###### ChatGPT said:

Liquid simulation in Houdini usually takes time, especially if it is detailed. In real-time, such simulations are generally simplified, but Houdini allows you to adjust the level of detail depending on the tasks. 

##### You said:

"Well, to master Houdini, probably, you need to spend many years on it. As far as I remember, it's all very complicated. To become a 3D designer making special effects for films, it's all unrealistically difficult."

00:15

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, Houdini is indeed complex, but you can start with the basics and gradually master more complicated things. There are many training courses and tutorials that help you get accustomed. The main thing is to start, and with practice comes mastery!

##### You said:

"Well, I started getting into this during my student years when I was 16 or 17, at that time it was still really possible to learn something, but now, it seems, I'm 40 years old and it will be difficult already."

00:16

###### ChatGPT said:

I understand, as you get older it seems harder to return. But if you're interested, you can start small, especially since you already have experience. The main thing is not to rush and enjoy the process. Age is not an obstacle to creativity!

##### You said:

"Well, yes, as far as I understand, MotionCapture can be done in Conv3UI, right? You can transfer these skeleton movements from video, or will it be inaccurate? Is it feasible to export what can be done in Conv3UI to Houdini?"

00:16

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, with motion capture in ComfyUI, you can capture movements and then export the data to Houdini. The accuracy depends on the quality of the capture, but it's sufficient for many projects. Houdini works well with such data, allowing you to refine the animation. 

##### You said:

"And what about generating these models? For example, can generative AI help? Are there plugins in Houdini that allow integrating something like ChatGPT? Some other models, so that I don't have to draw this model myself, I want to describe my character using StableDiffusion or something else, in short, are there any plugins in Houdini that help?"

00:34

###### ChatGPT said:

Houdini has plugins and scripts that allow for the integration of generative models, but they generally require additional configuration. For quickly creating characters, you can use external tools like Stable Diffusion and then import them into Houdini for refinement and animation.

##### You said:

"No, but StableDiffusion works with images, not with 3D objects."

00:06

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, Stable Diffusion works with 2D images. For 3D characters, you can use tools like DALL-E, Meshy, or 3D generative models. Their results can be imported into Houdini for further work and animation. 

##### You said:

"Wait, how did you say to create a Mesh? For example, I want to do this exactly like in StableDiffusion, but only for Mesh."

00:11

###### ChatGPT said:

To create 3D models from descriptions, you can use tools like DreamFusion or Meshy. They generate 3D objects based on text descriptions. Then the resulting models can be refined and animated in Houdini or other 3D editors. 

##### You said:

"Okay, I got it. And these Mesh tools, you mentioned, are they free programs, or do you have to pay for them?"

00:08

###### ChatGPT said:

Some of them are free, like Meshy. DreamFusion, on the other hand, might be part of paid services or require a subscription. It's worth checking the specific terms on their websites. 

##### You said:

"Then all this can be exported to Houdini, right?"

00:03

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, the generated models can be exported from these programs and imported into Houdini for further work and animation. 

##### You said:

"For example, if I know 3ds Max, can I import them into 3ds Max?"

00:04

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, 3D models created in other programs can be imported into 3ds Max. Usually, this is done through file formats such as OBJ or FBX. The main thing is to ensure that everything is transferred correctly. 

##### You said:

"Well, yes, but the animation itself, I mean, theoretically, you can capture the motion in Confi UI, and then transfer the Motion Capture to 3D Studio."

Sure! Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

00:13

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, you can! You capture movements in ComfyUI, export the data, for example, in FBX format, and then import it into 3D Studio Max. There, you can apply it to your model. ##### You said:

“Can you import in BX format in Confineur, right?”

00:04

###### ChatGPT said:

Exactly! ComfyUI allows exporting data in formats compatible with 3D Studio Max, including FBX. This is convenient for transferring animations. ##### You said:

“But isn’t IBX the same animation format?”

00:06

###### ChatGPT said:

FBX is a universal format that supports both 3D models and animations. It is often used for transferring data between different programs, including 3D Studio Max. ##### You said:

“Well, yes, you can make a little movie; it’s not that hard. I mean, you just have to start, just set up 3DMAX again. Well, it’s all quite old; I can imagine that. Are there any generative plugins for Max that are available?”

00:20

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, there are plugins for 3D Max that use generative AI, for example, for procedural modeling or texturing. It’s worth looking for ones like Forest Pack or RailClone. They can simplify many tasks. ##### You said:

“Well, yes, they are pretty heavyweight programs, but it’s interesting to create things in them. For example, a flying airplane; I want a model of an airplane, and I have to dive back into those models to find a collection of models to draw a car or an airplane.” 

00:24

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, with plugins and generative AI, you can quickly create models. There are libraries of ready-made models that can be integrated into 3D Max. This significantly simplifies the process, especially for complex objects like airplanes or cars. ##### You said:

“But I haven’t been working with such things for a long time, in principle, of course…”

00:05

###### ChatGPT said:

I understand,

##### You said:

“It would be possible to work on creating films, to write a story from scratch, for example, with the help of ChatGPT partially, to sketch some scheme and add details in ChatGPT, to create a movie that, say, will be about the future, about the near future when everyone has become cyborgs, about some borgs. Theoretically, it’s possible, well, to add some sci-fi scenarios, a lot can be described, and I have so much science fiction, on the other hand, I can use some books, and the same ChatGPT can suggest what element of the script can be described, and what to realize in 3D Studio. I mean, we need some dialogues if we are making a movie; we need to implement dialogues, and then we need to depict special effects; you need to think through the scenario of the movie, well, how complicated it is.”

01:20

###### ChatGPT said:

That’s an interesting project! ChatGPT can help with drafts of the script, dialogues, and ideas. Then you can bring it to life in 3D Studio Max by creating scenes and special effects. The combination of your knowledge and AI capabilities can yield great results. The main thing is to start with an idea and gradually develop it. ##### You said:

“Well, yes, I have drafts of some of my science fiction stories. They are about how a robot helps some underdeveloped civilization with artificial intelligence. So, in short, I have some of my own developments, and I can just keep writing. Well, I need to find time for this amidst my work. I don’t know how to set aside that time. I know that I have a lot of ideas, and I always have. And, well, I’m stuck in this software engineering, but I would actually like to engage in creativity my whole life. But I need money. Not necessarily for films, but just for living. Yes.”

00:58

###### ChatGPT said:

I understand. Creativity can be combined with work by setting aside time when it’s convenient. You can start with small projects, gradually developing your ideas. And over time, perhaps a way will be found to monetize your creative projects. The main thing is to do what brings you joy!

##### You said:

“Well, yes, I mean, I could work on that film, for example, create this project, gradually add some stories, texts, and scripts, and what specifically needs to be done. At the same time, set aside, say, two days a week for it, on weekends, and then add even more time for developing ideas, concepts, and some mini-storyboards. We need to think about what characters there will be; there’s a lot to think about here; it’s not some kind of game; it’s just a movie, so it will be simpler.”

00:48

###### ChatGPT said:

Great plan! Gradually developing the project will allow you to avoid burnout and enjoy the process. By setting aside time on weekends, you’ll be able to steadily add new elements, think through characters, and script. The main thing is to have fun and not rush. ##### You said:

“Well, on the other hand, the employer wants me to devote all my time to their project, the personnel selection where I work. So, I wonder how my interests will not conflict with the management’s interests.”

00:16

###### ChatGPT said:

Balance is important. You could discuss with management the possibility of setting aside time for creative projects outside of work. Employers often value employees with a creative approach. If everything is discussed openly, conflicts can be avoided. ##### You said:

“Well, how can I say… Excuse me, people. So, I have the right to devote two days a week to my hobby. Well, in general, we have such a concept of a hobby. That is, the management is not against employees having hobbies. So, I don't think there will be any conflicts here. Many people just play there. Some are doing some kind of dance. Well, who knows what else can be. And I will, for example, be engaged in movies.”

Here is the English translation of your text:

"Well, again, one thing is writing some text, developing ideas, and another thing is realizing the film. In general, these are completely different activities. Maybe I should start with the text."

"Yes, if a hobby brings pleasure, that is already valuable. Writing texts and developing ideas can be done gradually, while the realization of the film can come later, when there is more time and resources. The main thing is that you do not suppress your creative impulses!"

"Well, yes, no one is stopping me from sitting for a couple of days, for example, to study GUDDINI. But, you know, I’m afraid it might just end with me having studied a few lessons, while I actually need to create, that is, a real project. For example, I already know 3ds Max, so it will be much easier for me to do something in it because I know this program, and I don’t need to learn anything."

"Then it’s worth starting with 3D Max! If you already know this program well, starting a project in it will be easier and more comfortable. The main thing is to start making something, and then you can gradually add new elements."

"Yeah, so you recommend starting with 3D Max. I have already mastered some generative tools for generating videos, like SORU; it’s not that difficult, and it doesn't require any technical skills, it’s quite a simplified program."

"Yes, if you have already mastered Sora, it’s a great start for video generation. In 3D Max, you can focus on creating and animating models, and then combine everything in a video project. The main thing is to start, and it will be easier from there!"

"Well, Sora... there, you can’t really do some separate things, of course, you can make certain inserts on it, but not completely; you can program everything there a bit more precisely."

"I understand, Sora is more suitable for general scenes. In 3D Max, you will have more control over details and animation. You can combine: use Sora for the general background, and 3D Max for more detailed work."

"Yeah, so what topics? I am interested in things like transhumanism, some philosophical aspects of it, and well, something about the future. Those kinds of topics have always interested me: singularity, artificial intelligence, cybernization. What topics are better for making films?"

"Your interests are already a great foundation! Films about transhumanism, singularity, and the future are very relevant right now. People are curious about philosophical questions regarding how technology is changing our lives. The main thing is that the topic inspires you!"

"For example, in Mesh, you say I can create something, for example, can I say, 'generate a cylinder for me' in Mesh? Can I say that, and it will generate a cylinder for me?"

"Yes, with generative tools, you can set parameters and they will create the needed shape, for example, a cylinder. And then you can refine it in 3D Max. This significantly simplifies the process!"

"Well, yeah, I can't work 24 hours a day on this damn personnel project that has already bored me to death. I can actually devote a lot of time to this creative project, so I don't just stagnate at work, it turns out that I'm not doing much, time goes by, and I need to keep myself occupied with something creative."

"Absolutely! Creativity is a great way to not only relax but also to realize yourself. If the personnel project no longer brings you joy, you definitely need to find time for what inspires you. It will give you strength and energy!"

"Well, they do pay us for this personnel selection."

"That’s important, but you can always find a balance between work and creativity. The main thing is that you feel comfortable and can develop in both areas!"

"I'm glad you agree! After all, creativity is also a part of a full life."

"At work, they want me to focus on the deep study of AI, machine learning. There is such a deep technical work, which, in general, does not contain any special creativity. It’s necessary to correct these errors, to make some model deployments. But, agree, this is not creative work at all."

"Yes, that can be exhausting, especially if there’s a lack of creativity. Perhaps it’s worth talking to management about the possibility of combining technical tasks with creative ones. Or gradually finding time for creativity in your free hours."

"Well, yes, it's better to find free time for creativity in your spare time. I mean, if the management doesn't require, you know, to take some heights on your code base, then maybe it's worth devoting some time to it quietly. But my father is very careful about what I do. He will always say, 'Why don't you do some work?' He always says that."

"I understand; it can be difficult when there's pressure from outside. But remember that creativity is part of your personality. Gradually you will find a balance, and perhaps over time your father will see how important it is for you."

"Well, yeah, probably."

"Yes, the main thing is not to give up and gradually move towards your goal. I'm sure you will succeed!"

"I'm not giving up; I did some work on it for a while. Then I just gave it up because of work, because I had to earn money, but I wanted both creativity and everything else."

Here is the translation of the provided text into English:

"And now there are such opportunities that, in general, one person can manage quite a serious project. Well, that's it."

"Are you okay if I save this discussion for myself, the discussion with Chat GPT about the possibility of resuming a creative profession? And please write a list of tags that were touched upon in this particular discussion. Write the list of tags." 

"Of course, save it! Here’s an approximate list of tags: #creativity, #3D, #animation, #artificialintelligence, #transhumanism, #sciencefiction, #balance, #project, #3DMax, #motivation. Good luck with your project!"
