"We discussed attitudes towards cyborgization and AI in society, possible 'flaws' of humanity as a biological project, and explored the prospects of technology integration into the brain. Tags: cyborgization, AI, AGI, ASI, religion, ethics, flaws of humanity, future of technology. I wanted to continue the conversation about Protestantism and how it adapts transhumanist ideas in the American tradition. From this perspective, I would like to know what the current sentiments against transhumanism are among neo-Luddites, people who are opposed to progress. Perhaps there are many Christian interpreters of the Bible who are against transhumanism. Also, I wanted to know more about Hugo de Garis—what do you know about how he works and what he writes?"

ChatGPT said:
"Protestantism and transhumanism often intersect in discussions about the future of humanity. Among the opponents of transhumanism, neo-Luddites can be highlighted as they fear technological interference in human nature. Some Christian groups are also skeptical of transhumanist ideas, seeing them as a threat to divine purpose. Regarding Hugo de Garis, he is known for his work on the future of AI and potential conflicts between humans and machines, especially in the context of his concept of 'artilect'—superintelligent machines. He warns about the potential risks associated with creating such machines and actively discusses this topic."

You said:
“Yes, you're right. Let's have more detailed answers. Not short, as you’re used to, but more detailed. And what's interesting is that Hugo De Garis has warned for a long time that there will be a clash of interests. Two clans, as they say, who are for progress, for acceleration, including for the modification of a person. These are cyborgs and those who are against, who support the traditional way of life and all that.”

ChatGPT said:
"Hugo de Garis does indeed raise the issue of potential conflict between advocates of technological progress and those who hold traditional views. He introduces the concept of 'artilect'—superintelligent machines capable of surpassing human intelligence. In his scenarios, the future may split into two groups: 'Cosmists'—those who support the development of AI and transhumanism, and 'Terrans'—advocates for preserving human nature. He speculated that this could lead to serious social and even military conflicts. This creates an interesting field for discussions about how humanity can cope with such challenges and what steps to take to avoid negative consequences."

You said:
"Well, yes, this was actually predictable, and there's a lot of hate surrounding artificial intelligence. People see, but still, not everyone realizes how much it can affect the labor market. Not everyone has understood this yet because not everyone uses ChatGPT; not everyone understands the potential of the technology. But soon, I think, there will be more and more of these protest sentiments. People will start losing jobs quickly, the market can't adapt fast enough, and all that."

ChatGPT said:
"Yes, such concerns are quite justified. With the growing capabilities of AI, especially in automation, there is indeed a risk that many professions may change or disappear. This could trigger a wave of social discontent, especially among those whose jobs are at risk. Protest sentiments may escalate if adequate solutions for retraining or support for the affected are not proposed. It is important to discuss and seek balance between technological progress and social consequences in advance, to mitigate potential negative effects."

You said:
"As for cyborgization, what do you think society will think about human enhancement at that moment? Do you think these ideas will become popular someday?"

ChatGPT said:
"Cyborgization, or the integration of technology into the human body, is already causing interest and discussions. Society is gradually getting used to the ideas of improving the human body through implants or neurointerfaces. The popularity of such ideas will likely increase as new successful examples and scientific achievements emerge. Of course, there will be certain resistance, especially from conservative circles, but overall, if technologies bring benefits and improve quality of life, they will find their supporters."

You said:
"Well, yes, this has already happened, like when... when the car was invented, many laughed at car users, at drivers. They thought that horses were much better than using a car. They didn't take it seriously at first. Then people started buying cars when it became affordable."

ChatGPT said:
"Yes, that's a good example! Many technological innovations initially evoke skepticism and even ridicule. Over time, as they spread and prove beneficial, new technologies become an integral part of life. With cyborgization, a similar situation may occur. People will gradually realize the advantages and start perceiving such changes as a natural step forward. The key is the accessibility and safety of these technologies, so they provide real benefits without serious risks."

You said:
"What do you say, for example, about the connection of an external artificial neocortex that will be in the cloud and will think much faster? A person's consciousness and intellect are connected. We are aware of all our thoughts, we try to experience them, our inner experiences, so that they exist."

Here’s the translation of the provided text into English:

"But what if intelligence starts throwing a million thoughts at us per second? How will we survive these millions of conscious experiences?”

00:35
ChatGPT said:
"Interesting point! If an external neural network works much faster than the human brain, there could be a problem with perceiving such a volume of information. It's important for humans that thoughts and experiences are meaningful and comprehensible. If the flow of information is too large, it could lead to overload. The solution may involve creating interfaces that filter and adapt information, making it digestible. It's also possible that over time, the brain will adapt, as it has with other technologies."

You said:
"Well, yeah, but the brain can’t produce more than one thought per second anyway; you can’t somehow accelerate it or anything like that."

00:09
ChatGPT said:
"Yes, the human brain has its limitations. It evolved over millions of years, and its speed of information processing is constrained. Therefore, any attempts at integrating AI with the brain must take these features into account. Such technologies may help process complex tasks, filter, or pre-process data, and then provide it in a format that's easy to understand. This kind of synergy could expand capabilities without overloading consciousness."

You said:
"Yeah, so, in principle, this whole power could pass by a person, right? I mean, the neurons themselves are the bottleneck; biologically, they work slowly."

00:17
ChatGPT said:
"Yes, neurons do indeed work slower than modern processors. But even with that, integration could be beneficial. For instance, AI could perform pre-processing of data, highlight key points, and speed up decision-making. It is important that technologies serve as complements rather than replacements. This way, overload can be avoided, making interaction comfortable for humans."

You said:
"Well, yes, so you're suggesting not to radically change the neurons completely with artificial ones, but rather propose some external interface that would give advice, like ChatGPT, only it’s built-in, and the brain would act as an external module. You could mentally address it and occasionally ask questions. So it doesn’t fundamentally change the brain's structure and all that."

00:26
ChatGPT said:
"Yes, the idea is to create an interface that complements rather than replaces the brain. Such a module could serve as a sort of assistant that one can mentally consult for help or advice. This would allow for an expansion of capabilities while preserving the natural structure of thought. This approach combines the best of both worlds: the speed and power of AI with the unique abilities of the human brain."

ChatGPT said:
"Yes, Hugo de Garis has indeed expressed similar ideas about brain-machine interfaces. He believes the integration of such devices into the brain could radically change cognitive abilities. Theoretically, such a chip could compensate for inherent deficiencies or significantly enhance capabilities. However, in practice, there are many questions ranging from technical challenges to ethical and medical aspects. These ideas remain largely futuristic, but they certainly stimulate discussions about the limits of what is possible."

You said:
"If we create AGI, Artificial General Intelligence, and further ASI, then fantastical ideas come closer to reality because AI has exponentially more power to realize even super-fantastical ideas."

00:23
ChatGPT said:
"Yes, with the development of artificial intelligence, especially at the AGI and ASI levels, the boundaries of what is possible indeed expand. Such powerful systems could bring to life ideas that previously seemed pure fantasy. However, it is not only the technical embodiment that is important, but also the understanding of the consequences. These technologies carry both enormous potential and serious risks, so their implementation should be accompanied by a thoughtful approach and ethical frameworks."

You said:
"But let's say that these religious groups will always be against it; we can take as an axiom that they will always oppose any changes to the human brain. Even if it's a person suffering from Parkinson's or dementia, there's no other way to correct their condition except through implants; they would protest even against that."

00:33
ChatGPT said:
"Yes, conservative religious groups often have a skeptical view of technological interventions, especially concerning the human body and brain. Their concerns may be related to preserving the 'natural' order and interfering with divine creation. However, as technology advances and positive experiences with implants accumulate, some religious communities may soften their stance, particularly when it comes to helping individuals with serious ailments. Dialogue and examples of successful applications could contribute to a gradual change in attitude."

You said:
"Well, yes, and can you list for me some flaws in the design of the human project, if we say that there are bugs in God's design? God allowed some mistakes in the design of humans, meaning how imperfect this system is. Can you list, for example, a dozen blunders that were made in the design of humans? Let's assume, for the hypothesis, that this is a divine creation."

00:35
ChatGPT said:
"When considering humans from the perspective of an 'engineering project,' several conditional 'flaws' can be identified. For example:
1. Fragility of the body: Humans are vulnerable to injuries, diseases, and wear on joints.
2. Limited lifespan: Compared to some animals, humans live relatively short lives.
3. Imperfect regeneration: The ability to heal tissues is limited.
4. Psychological vulnerabilities: Prone to stress, depression, and mental disorders.
5. Suboptimal anatomy: For instance, back problems due to posture.
6. ..." 

(Note: The original text seems to cut off after item 5, and the rest is not provided.)

Here’s the translation of the text into English:

"Imperfect memory: Tendency to forgetfulness and inaccuracies. 8. Dependence on external factors: Need for food, water, oxygen. 9. Aging: Gradual loss of functions with age. 10. Limited adaptability: Not always quick to adjust to sudden changes in the environment. 11. Emotional conflicts: Internal contradictions that hinder rational decisions. Of course, all these 'flaws' depend on perspective." 

You said:
"Well, yes, that’s great, it instantly sums up the moment, that is to say I would need to recall all this, I need to remember all these points, because it would be difficult for me to extract all this from my memory." 

ChatGPT said:
"I’m glad it was useful! If you need to remember or save something, you can always make a note or record the points in a format that works for you. If you need to discuss or clarify anything else, just let me know!"
