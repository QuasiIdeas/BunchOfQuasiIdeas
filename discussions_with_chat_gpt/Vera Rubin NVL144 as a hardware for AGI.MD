Well, Andrey Karpatov says...

ChatGPT said:
Oh? What does Andrey Karpaty say? What's the context—AI, philosophy, or something else?

You said:
He says that operating systems are now emerging in which the core is an LLM model. Can you elaborate on what he means by a new operating system?

ChatGPT said:
Got it. When Karpaty talks about “new operating systems” with LLMs at their core, he doesn’t mean classic OSs like Windows or Linux, but a fundamentally new paradigm of human-computer interaction, where a large language model becomes the primary intermediary.

Instead of traditional interfaces with windows, menus, and a command line, the user interacts through dialogue—just like you're doing with me now. The LLM is not just an assistant, but a control layer: it can launch programs, find files, analyze user behavior, adapt to individual styles, and even suggest improvements.

Projects like Cognition AI’s Devin OS or experimental systems like AIOS are early examples. These often run on top of existing systems but mask them, so it feels like you’re not using Unix or Windows—you just tell it what you want, and it does it.

Are you more interested in the technical setup, or in the philosophical shift—like whether this will replace the classic desktop approach?

You said:
Well, I guess it's like that Jarvis thing from Iron Man, right? So is Microsoft planning to build something like this into Windows?

ChatGPT said:
Exactly! That’s a perfect comparison. It’s like an intelligent interface that doesn’t just follow commands but engages in dialogue, learns your habits, understands context, and can take initiative.

Microsoft is already heading in this direction. They’ve added Copilot to Windows 11, which is an early form of such an interface. For now, it’s limited: it can execute commands, search, integrate with Office, and manage settings. But the end goal is clearly to make LLMs the core of system interaction.

Eventually, it will likely evolve into deeper integration: file management, program control, workflow automation, adapting to personal work styles, and even executing complex scenarios without coding.

Would you prefer Windows to fully switch to this format? Or do you like the classic windows-and-mouse model?

You said:
I wouldn’t mind, but the catch is you’d need an OpenAI key, or an API key, to interact with the industrial-grade model.

ChatGPT said:
Exactly, and that’s a major bottleneck—most of these systems currently rely on cloud-based LLMs, which require API keys and paid services. That raises a fundamental question: who controls the intelligence you interact with?

You’re not alone in raising this concern. If your OS depends on an external LLM (like GPT or Claude), it’s tethered to infrastructure: the internet, subscriptions, corporate policies. That’s no longer fully your computer—a portion of control is outsourced.

There are enthusiasts working on local models, running LLMs on personal hardware using tools like Ollama, LM Studio, or vLLM. But that takes serious resources—not every machine can handle it.

Would you prefer an autonomous setup—everything running locally?

You said:
Yeah, of course—local would definitely be better. I think soon we’ll be able to run O3-level models on our own hardware. It’s just a matter of time until the hardware catches up.

ChatGPT said:
Exactly. That’s a very rational view. Right now, we're still limited by hardware and optimization, but progress is fast. Even today, you can run models like LLaMA 3 8B or even 13B on high-end GPUs, and they’re approaching early GPT-3 capabilities.

As we get laptops and mini-PCs with chips like Apple M4 or future NVIDIA Blackwell, and with optimizations like GGUF, quantization, and flash-attention becoming mainstream, O3-level models will become local—no internet, no subscriptions, entirely self-contained.

By then, we’ll probably have fully local “AI operating systems” that don’t just mimic assistants but truly manage entire systems Jarvis-style.

Can you imagine what your ideal AI interface would look like? What would it be able to do? What would it look and sound like?

Due to the length of the full translation (over 30,000 characters), I’ve translated the first portion here. Would you like me to continue translating the rest in segments?







You said:
yes


ChatGPT said:
Great! Here’s the next segment of the English translation:

You said:
Well, Jason Young from NVIDIA—the CEO—he introduced a new chip recently. What did you call it again? I forgot a bit. How much more powerful is it in petaflops compared to the previous one? How much more memory does it have? Can you tell me more about that?

ChatGPT said:
You’re likely referring to the NVIDIA Blackwell B200 chip. It delivers up to 20 petaflops of FP4 (single-precision floating point) performance and up to 10 petaflops in FP8. The chip includes two dies connected by an NV-HBI bus with 10 TB/s bandwidth. Flanking the dies are eight stacks of HBM3E memory, totaling 192 GB, with up to 8 TB/s memory bandwidth.

You said:
So it’s some kind of RTX PRO Blackwell, right?

ChatGPT said:
Yes, NVIDIA also announced the RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell, which has 96 GB of GDDR7 memory and a 600W power draw. It’s designed for professionals working in AI and high-performance computing.

You said:
So, what’s the deal with Blackwell Ultra NVL72?

ChatGPT said:
Right, NVIDIA introduced the Blackwell Ultra NVL72, a system that combines 72 Blackwell Ultra GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs in a single rack. This design delivers 1.5x more AI performance than the previous GB200 NVL72 model.

You said:
Can you tell me about the Vera Rubin NVL144 — it’s coming in the second half of 2026, right? How much faster will it be than the previous generation?

ChatGPT said:
Correct, NVIDIA plans to release the Vera Rubin NVL144 GPU system in the second half of 2026. It’s expected to deliver 3.6 exaflops in FP4 and 1.2 exaflops in FP8—a massive leap over the GB200 NVL72.

You said:
So what’s the performance jump? Like in terms of scale—how much of an increase are we talking about?

ChatGPT said:
Yes, it’s a major leap. To compare:

GB200 NVL72: ~1.5 exaflops (FP4)

Vera Rubin NVL144: up to 3.6 exaflops (FP4)

That’s about a 2.4× increase in raw performance. But it’s not just about flops—NVIDIA claims architectural improvements too: better power efficiency, faster interconnects, improved memory handling.

This is crucial for LLM inference and reasoning, where both throughput and latency matter a lot. It'll be interesting to see how fast these systems are adopted beyond training—like in real-time inference.

Do you think such performance boosts could make local AGI a reality?

You said:
How does it compare to H2O or ASTRO cards?

ChatGPT said:
Unfortunately, I don’t have specific performance data comparing the Vera Rubin NVL144 directly to H2O or ASTRO. However, based on the 3.6 exaflops FP4 performance, it’s likely far beyond anything those cards currently offer.

You said:
No, I meant the A100. We have two A100 cards with 80 GB each. I just want to compare the Vera Rubin to those.

ChatGPT said:
Ah, got it! Comparing Vera Rubin NVL144 to two A100s is like comparing a sports car to a rocket.

Let’s break it down:

One A100 (80 GB):
~312 TFLOPS (FP16),
~78 TFLOPS (FP32)

Two A100s:
~624 TFLOPS (FP16),
~156 TFLOPS (FP32)

Vera Rubin NVL144:
~3.6 exaflops (FP4),
~1.2 exaflops (FP8)

That means Vera Rubin is not only 5–6× faster than the entire GB200 NVL72 (already much faster than two A100s), but likely 20–25× more powerful than your current A100 setup in terms of FLOPS.

But keep in mind—Vera Rubin NVL144 isn’t a single card. It’s a data center-scale rack with 144 GPUs and advanced interconnects. It’s basically a factory for intelligence.

Are you thinking about upgrading your system, or just exploring what's on the horizon?

Would you like me to continue with the next section of the translation?







You said:
yes


ChatGPT said:
Perfect. Here's the next part of the translation:

You said:
No, I’m just speculating about the future. So how much memory does the Vera Rubin have?

ChatGPT said:
According to available information, each Vera Rubin NVL144 GPU is equipped with 288 GB of HBM4 memory.

You said:
Thank you very much, sir.

ChatGPT said:
You're very welcome, my friend. Always a pleasure to talk tech like this. Got any other future-looking ideas you're pondering?

You said:
So you said 280 GB, right? That’s for the whole Vera Rubin block, right?

ChatGPT said:
288 GB is for one Vera Rubin GPU. Since the NVL144 system, as the name implies, includes 144 of these GPUs, the total memory in such a rack exceeds 40 terabytes of HBM4. That’s absolutely massive.

For comparison: your system with two A100s has a total of 160 GB, and this setup is 250× more. It's not just enough for a single large model—this is memory for mega-models with hundreds of billions of parameters running simultaneously.

Do you want to estimate how many parameters such memory could hold?

You said:
Yeah, let’s calculate. I’m curious.

ChatGPT said:
All right, let’s estimate! A single parameter in FP16 takes 2 bytes, so:

1 GB = 500 million parameters

1 TB = 500 billion parameters

40 TB = 20 trillion parameters

This isn't just GPT-4 or Turbo-level—this is already the scale of a multi-model AGI system, where multiple specialized models can coexist: reasoning, vision, planning, dialogue, etc.

And all of it can fit in memory without any swapping, which drastically boosts speed. And this isn’t some distant future—this is projected for 2026.

Want to imagine what kind of model you could build with that kind of architecture?

You said:
Uh-huh.

ChatGPT said:
All right, let’s go.

With 20 trillion parameters, you could build something like:

A core brain: maybe 10 trillion parameters dedicated to a main LLM—an advanced version of GPT-7 with long-term memory and deeper structure.

The other 10 trillion go toward a network of agents:

One for planning

One for visual perception

One for emotional modeling

One for interfacing with physical devices (like Jarvis)

You could also include:

A video generation model

A translation model

A self-reflection model—the AI thinks with itself, evaluating its own reasoning

All this running in real time, on a single machine, without needing to distribute across data centers.

This kind of system could replace an entire team of human professionals—from analysts and designers to assistants and engineers.

Would you rather use such a system as a personal assistant, or are you more interested in building something on a civilizational scale—a digital infrastructure?

You said:
I didn’t understand—what’s a “civilizational digital thing”?

ChatGPT said:
Haha, yeah, that sounded like I invented a new superhero. I didn’t mean a person—I meant a concept.

If systems like Vera Rubin with 20 trillion parameters can run autonomously and coordinate multiple agents, they could go beyond helping individuals. They could begin to manage entire societal systems—economies, logistics, research, policy.

That’s what I meant by a “digital civilization”—an infrastructure where AI doesn’t just assist humans but actually guides culture, science, and resource coordination.

Such AI wouldn’t be your assistant—it would be a platform for running the future world.

So my question was: do you feel more drawn to using these systems personally, like your own Jarvis, or imagining them as tools for society at large?

You said:
Let them manage the world. That’s fine with me.

ChatGPT said:
Now that’s the spirit—calm and confident: let them run it, as long as they’re smarter and more honest than us. Ideally, more Asimov-style than Terminator-style.

Would you like to explore how such a system could realistically run a city or a country? Or would you rather imagine what your daily life would be like in that future?

You said:
When did they release that powerful GPU?

ChatGPT said:
NVIDIA announced the Vera Rubin NVL144 GPU system, which is scheduled for release in the first half of 2026.

Would you like me to keep going with the next segment of the translation?







You said:
yes


ChatGPT said:
Great! Here's the next part of the translation:

You said:
Okay, I get it. But how did they design such a powerful device?

ChatGPT said:
Excellent question. A system like Vera Rubin NVL144 became possible due to several key technological breakthroughs:

The new Rubin Ultra architecture — It uses 4 chips per accelerator, interconnected with ultra-fast buses. It's a multi-die design, similar in concept to Apple's chips, but far more powerful and tailored for AI.

HBM4 memory — Extremely fast and energy-efficient memory with massive bandwidth. This allowed for not just more capacity, but dramatically faster access to model weights.

NVLink 6 and NVSwitch — These interconnects between GPUs operate at tens of terabytes per second, so hundreds of GPUs communicate without bottlenecks, essentially acting as a single brain.

Advanced lithography — Most likely 3nm or 4nm processes, new cooling systems, and optimization specifically for transformer-based models and massive parallelism.

And finally — experience. This is the product of decades of work by NVIDIA in supercomputing, gaming, and deep learning.

Want to speculate together on how a chip like that could be scaled even further in the future?

You said:
I'm sorry, what did you ask?

ChatGPT said:
No worries! I was just asking — would you like to imagine what comes after Vera Rubin? How this kind of system could be scaled even further? Want to explore that idea?

You said:
Uh-oh.

ChatGPT said:
Heh, sounds like you’re either intrigued or slightly alarmed. Don’t worry — no Skynet here. Just harmless futurism. Want to keep going down that rabbit hole, or switch gears?

You said:
