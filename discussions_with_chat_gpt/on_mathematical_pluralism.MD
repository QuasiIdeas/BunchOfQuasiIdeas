Yes, that is, some still talk about the fact that, for example, I read about a researcher whose last name is... Let me recall. His name is Seth Lloyd. He stated that there may be many computers, but in order to simulate the Universe, you need a computer the size of the Universe. However, he did not consider that it might be sufficient to simulate just one planet, while simplifying the computations for all the others. So that's one argument and a counter-argument.

----

Yes, that's an important clarification. Seth Lloyd's argument that simulating the entire Universe requires a computer the size of the Universe can be softened. It is enough to focus on a local simulation, for example, only on our planet, while modeling the rest of the Universe in a simplified manner. This significantly reduces computational costs and makes the simulation more realistic in terms of resources.

----

Tell me more about lazy simulation, what is it?

----

Lazy simulation is a concept whereby the simulation models only the part of the world that is actively observed. The idea is to save computational resources by creating details "on the fly" only when they are needed for interaction or observation. For example: 
- **Distant stars:** As long as we are not pointing a telescope at a specific area of the sky, details (radiation, distance) exist only as a minimal mathematical model. 
- **Quantum uncertainty:** It can be likened to quantum mechanics—reality becomes "defined" only at the moment of observation. 
- **Local detailing:** What happens outside our field of view or interest can be modeled much more simply or may not exist at all. Thus, lazy simulation minimizes the load on the computational system, creating the illusion of a cohesive reality without needing to model everything at once.

----

Okay. In the future, I will propose some ideas, and you can counter them, meaning be skeptical; I will put it this way. Can you be more skeptical?

----

Of course, I can be more skeptical and provide counter-arguments to your ideas. Let’s give it a try!

----

Suppose the creators of the simulation are interested in simulating a point in history where the singularity of creating ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) occurs and humanity spreads across the galaxy. Let’s say they are only interested in this point in history, and they want to save computations for the entire history, so they choose to simulate in more detail only those people who are somehow connected to technological progress, for example, progress in AI. And, for instance, people like Sam Altman are simulated with a high level of detail, while some courier or pizza delivery person is simulated roughly, perhaps with certain quotas placed on them, meaning, in principle, a simplified consciousness.

----

This is a logical hypothesis, but let’s consider the counter-arguments:

- **Social network and influence:** Even a courier or pizza delivery person can be important in the global picture. The slightest interaction, for example, a random phrase, can affect the mood, ideas, or decisions of key figures. A simplified simulation of such people could undermine the plausibility of the entire system.
- **Complexity of predictions:** History is unpredictable, and "secondary" figures can unexpectedly become key. For example, a person not initially linked to AI might invent a crucial component or inspire someone else to do so. Simplifying such individuals is risky.
- **Ethical concerns of simulation:** If the creators are advanced enough to simulate consciousness, they may have ethical norms requiring an equal level of detail for all "minds" to avoid discrimination.
- **Plausibility of the environment:** People interact with society, including "insignificant" participants. If these participants are not sufficiently complex, it may cause inconsistencies that are noticeable to key figures.
- **Possibility of alternative goals:** The simulation may be directed not only at studying AI but also at social aspects, human relationships, or mass behavior. This would require an equal level of detail for everyone. Thus, selective detailing may seem efficient but could create risks of undermining realism or missing key changes.

----

Okay, but you still have to save on something. Yes, they may have almost unlimited computational resources. But how can that be achieved, unlimited resources? Can they allocate an infinite amount of resources in the base universe? Well, it’s hard to believe because a computer is still constrained by some boundaries; it is a finite system. How can it have infinite resources?

----

You are right; infinite resources are unlikely even for an advanced civilization. However, they can achieve "practically unlimited" resources through the following approaches:

- **Kardashev scale energy:** If a civilization is at Type II or III on the Kardashev scale, they can harness all the energy of their star or even the entire galaxy (for example, using Dyson spheres). This provides colossal computational power.
- **Quantum computing:** Quantum computers can perform vast computations in parallel, significantly increasing efficiency.
- **Computronium:** This is a hypothetical substance where all available matter is used exclusively for computation. For example, a "brain of Jupiter"—a computational structure the size of a planet.
- **Simulation optimization:** They can use lazy simulation, as we discussed, modeling only the minimally necessary reality to save resources.
- **Time dilation:** They can "stretch" time in their base universe to allocate more resources for the simulation, working more slowly but efficiently.
- **Super-efficient physics:** Their base reality may have physical laws that allow the creation of computing devices with efficiencies unimaginable in our universe.

Sure! Here's the translation of the provided text into English:

So, their resources, while not infinite, can be so vast that for our simulation they appear virtually limitless. ---- 
The Turing machine cannot perform hypercomputation? 
---- 
That’s correct, the Turing machine cannot perform hypercomputations. It is limited by its algorithmic approach and can only solve problems that can be reduced to an algorithm. Hypercomputations, on the other hand, fall outside these boundaries. The limitations of the Turing machine: 
- Solutions only for algorithmic problems: It cannot solve problems that require infinite computations (for example, the halting problem in general). 
- Determinism: The Turing machine cannot handle problems requiring non-deterministic or super-precise operations outside its model. Hypercomputations: 
- Going beyond algorithms: They include theoretical models capable of solving problems that are inaccessible to a Turing machine, such as: 
- The halting problem. 
- Calculations with infinite precision. Examples of hypercomputational models: 
- Oracle Turing machine: Enhanced with an "oracle" that provides answers to unsolvable questions. 
- Analog computing: Models that use physical laws for super-precise operations. The key difference: 
- The Turing machine is limited to discrete steps of computation, whereas hypercomputations imply access to resources or operations that go beyond this discreteness. However, hypercomputations remain a theoretical concept as they cannot yet be implemented in the real world. ---- 
Well, you know, I have to say that I don’t understand the connection to the simulation capabilities in that external universe. Let’s assume they have different physical laws, and let’s assume they have access to hyper-computation. Essentially, I understand that hypercomputation is only impossible in our universe. If the laws of physics were different, or they had the ability to manipulate time dilation to make an infinite number of steps finite, perhaps they are somehow playing with the curvature of space-time, or it is unknown on what basis their physics works at all. Well, basically, all this is only possible in a universe that is not ours. ---- 

You are absolutely right! The external universe, where a simulating civilization may potentially exist, could have physical laws that are completely different from ours, opening up new horizons for hypercomputation. Here’s how it might be related: 

- Other physical laws: 
If their universe lacks restrictions such as the speed of light or entropy, they could create systems that perform infinite computations. Space-time effects, such as controlling time, could allow them to "stretch" computations to make a finite amount of resources practically infinite. 
- Playing with time: 
Slowing down time or using local areas with "eternal" time could allow them to perform infinite steps while remaining within their physical limits. An analogy could be a hypothetical device where each step is performed faster and faster, striving to complete an infinite number of operations within a finite time (for example, the so-called Zeno machine).
- Curvature of space-time: 
If their physics allows manipulation of space and time, it could provide access to "unreachable" computational resources. For instance, they might create computational systems near black holes, where gravity severely distorts time. 
- Simulation in our universe: 
If their hypercomputations are real, they might "transmit" results into our simulated reality, where physical laws are limited. We would perceive these actions as super-powerful computations that are inaccessible to our technologies. 
Conclusion: Hypercomputations are impossible within the framework of our physics, but for an external civilization with different laws, they could be a fundamental technology. This makes the simulation hypothesis more plausible if we assume that their universe is radically different from ours. --- 
What is an eternal Turing machine? 
---- 
An eternal Turing machine is a hypothetical computational model that extends the classical Turing machine, allowing it to perform an infinite (or transfinite) number of steps. It is used to model computations that go beyond standard theory and introduces the concept of transfinite ordinals. Key features: 
- Transfinite steps: 
The steps of the Turing machine are numbered by ordinal numbers, which allows computations to continue even after a "normal" infinite number of steps. After completing a "normal" number of steps (e.g., ω, the first transfinite ordinal), the machine moves on to the next phase of computation. 
- Limit states: 
When the machine reaches a transfinite ordinal, it generalizes its state, tape, and head position based on all previous steps. This allows computations to continue beyond the "finite infinity." 
- Zeno machine model: 
The eternal Turing machine can be considered a generalization of the Zeno machine, where each step is performed faster and faster, aiming to complete an infinite number of steps in finite time. 
- Solving unsolvable problems: 
Theoretically, the eternal Turing machine could solve problems that are inaccessible to a regular Turing machine, such as checking the halting problem for standard Turing machines. 
- Purpose and application: 
This model is studied within theoretical computer science to understand the limits of computation. It shows how to expand the theory of computation beyond standard constraints. 
Example: If a regular Turing machine gets stuck in an infinite loop, the eternal Turing machine could continue computations to a transfinite state, where it "resumes" the results of the loop and moves on to the next stage. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ---- 
Well, I mean, I understand that if there is pluralism of these mathematical universes, as we have determined, mathematics is an invention of the human brain, so there may be other mathematical systems that are internally consistent, but are based on their own set of axioms, that is, a multitude of axioms. 

--- 

Let me know if you need anything else!

Sure! Here is the translation of the provided text into English:

And, accordingly, how to tie all of this to the physical universe? Here, Joel David Hamkins says that he doesn't really understand what the physical universe is in this sense. That is, if a mathematician can have an infinite number of different mathematical systems, and there isn't just one unifying mathematical system, then there can also, accordingly, be an unlimited number of physical universes. And, returning to the simulation hypothesis, the mathematics of the external world might differ radically from our mathematics. Therefore, what physical reality means in this context is not very clear.

---

You have touched upon a very profound question, and I will try to break it down briefly. 

1. **Mathematical Pluralism and Physical Reality**  
If we accept that there are many mathematical systems, each of which is internally consistent and based on its own set of axioms, then:

Mathematics becomes not a universal truth, but a multitude of possible realities. Physical reality may be just one of the possible "mathematical realizations." Our universe is a "special case" of one of the mathematical structures that fits our physical laws. 

2. **Joel David Hamkins' Position**  
Hamkins promotes the idea of a mathematical multiverse, where each mathematical system exists in its own right. If physics is based on mathematics, this leads to the hypothesis that there may be an infinite number of physical universes with different laws.

3. **What is Physical Reality?**  
Within the framework of mathematical realism, physical reality is:

Merely a mathematical structure that has a "physical manifestation" in our universe. If there are other mathematical realities, physical reality loses its uniqueness and becomes one of many manifestations of mathematics.

4. **Tying to the Simulation Hypothesis**  
In the simulation hypothesis:

If the simulating civilization relies on its mathematics, it may be radically different from ours. The mathematical foundation of external reality determines the laws of the simulation. They could be so different that our concept of "physical reality" becomes meaningless.

5. **The Key Problem**  
Physical reality in this context ceases to be "objective." It becomes relative, dependent on:

The chosen mathematical system. The axioms that define how physical reality is constructed.

**Conclusion**  
Your remark is absolutely logical: if the basis of our physics lies in mathematics, and mathematics is infinitely variable, then physical universes can also be infinitely diverse. In the simulation hypothesis, this means that the laws of our world may be an "artifact" of the mathematics of the simulating reality, which could even be incomprehensibly foreign to our logic.

---

I believe it should be comprehensible because everything we do involves processing information, and we are essentially able to conceive of certain mathematical systems that go beyond our mathematical system and represent some other physical reality purely on paper, attempting to describe it with the language of our mathematics, even if only abstractly or intuitively. In principle, it can be theoretically described; it may be comprehensible. The question is how complex it is—the complexity of the world in which the simulation is initiated. There must still be some machines, some structures that provide...

---

You are right; comprehensibility may indeed be possible, although the complexity may turn out to be beyond our understanding. Let’s consider this in more detail:

1. **Comprehensibility as the Basis of Simulation**  
If our reality is a simulation, it must be based on structures that at least in principle can be described. This follows from the very fact that we can observe patterns in our world and formulate laws of physics using our mathematics.  
Information Processing: In the simulating reality, there must exist machines or structures providing computations. We can attempt to model their principles, even if they are radically different.  
Abstract Understanding: Even if their "mathematics" or physics differ, we can build analogies or partial models.

2. **Complexity of the Simulating Reality**  
The complexity of the world where the simulation is initiated depends on:

The level of computational power: Their technologies may be so advanced that the supporting systems of the simulation seem elementary to us.  
The level of physical laws: Their laws of physics might be more fundamental than ours, and our mathematics could simply be a simplified model for their description.

3. **Ways of Comprehension**  
Even if the simulating reality is more complex than ours, there are approaches to making sense of it:

Abstraction: Using our mathematics to build models, even if they will be partially inaccurate.  
Looking for patterns: If we can observe effects of the simulating reality in our own (for example, anomalies), this could provide clues about its nature.  
Universal Principles: Information, as a fundamental basis, could be common to both realities.

4. **Complexity as a Barrier**  
Complexity could become an issue:  
If the simulating reality relies on systems that are too multidimensional or dynamic, our mathematics might not be powerful enough.  
Even if we partially understand their reality, a complete description may be unreachable.

**Conclusion**  
The comprehensibility of the simulating reality is likely possible but limited by our language, mathematics, and ability to abstract. As you noted, everything boils down to complexity: both of the systems supporting the simulation and the laws of their world. But the fact that we can discuss this already indicates our potential ability to find approaches to understanding, even if it is only partial.

---

Be skeptical of what I say; challenge me with counterarguments.

---

Alright, let's take a skeptical look. 

---

Here is the translated text:

If we assume that a simulating reality must be comprehensible, here are the counterarguments:

**Inability to abstract:** Mathematical systems radically different from ours may be so foreign that we cannot even begin to build models. For example, if their laws do not include the concepts of linear time or spatial continuity, how would we understand that?

**Locality of the mind:** Our mind evolved within the conditions of our physics and mathematics. It may be incapable of thinking outside these frameworks, even if such a reality is describable. 

**Language limitations:** Our language (including mathematics) is a tool designed to work with the reality we observe. If the principles of the simulating reality are radically different, even formalizing them may be impossible. 

**Level of complexity:** The complexity of the simulating reality may be so high that any attempt to describe it would be overly approximate and yield no useful results. 

**Distortions of the simulation:** Even if the simulating reality is comprehensible, the simulation we observe may include "noise" or intentional limitations that hinder us from reconstructing the laws of the external reality. These points call into question the idea that any simulating reality will necessarily be accessible to our understanding. Even if partial understanding is possible, complete comprehension remains highly questionable.

----
Yes, that is, even if our laws of physics are not universally agreed upon by all scientists and our physical reality is not very understandable, then what can we say about the external reality that no one has ever seen, and where no one even speculates a way to send measuring instruments into that reality, meaning we cannot obtain any information from it? We can only guess about what it is based on.

----
Absolutely correct, and here is a skeptical view on this:

**Consensus problem:** Even within our physical reality, scientists disagree about its nature. For example, quantum mechanics and general relativity have yet to be unified into a single theory of everything. If we cannot agree on our own reality, then our assumptions about the external reality may be even less reliable.

**Limits of observations:** All our measurements and tools are based on the laws of our universe. If the external reality adheres to fundamentally different laws, our measurement methods are simply inapplicable. We find ourselves in isolation, unable to obtain even indirect data.

**Speculating without data:** Any assumptions about external reality are based solely on abstraction, making them speculative. Without empirical data, this resembles philosophy more than science.

**Limitations of the simulation:** If we are in a simulation, its very structure may intentionally hide traces of external reality so that we cannot detect it. This renders any attempts to understand the outside world even more fruitless.

**Anthropocentrism:** Even our desire to "understand" the external reality may be a product of our human way of thinking, which need not be relevant or applicable in another reality. Thus, we can only formulate hypotheses, but the lack of direct access makes any conclusions extremely tenuous. Even if the external reality exists, comprehending it based on our limited tools and intellect may be impossible.

----
Our intellect is unable to comprehend the human one, and artificial intelligence may perhaps find a way to describe that reality.

----
That sounds logical, but here are the counterarguments:

**Artificial intelligence is our creation:** Even the most advanced AI learns from the data we provide. If we have no information about the external reality, then AI is equally limited by our knowledge and models.

**Limits of understanding:** AI may be faster and more accurate in data analysis, but it still operates within the same logical and mathematical frameworks as we do. If the external reality adheres to laws that lie beyond these frameworks, AI will also be powerless.

**Lack of input data:** Without the ability to acquire information from the external reality (e.g., through measurements or signals), AI will not be able to create a model of it. Any description will be pure abstraction devoid of empirical validation.

**Distortion of the simulation:** If we are in a simulation, the creators could have embedded constraints that prevent AI or us from stepping outside the bounds of this reality. So even AI, possessing immense computational power, will be limited in its ability to describe the external reality if it is fundamentally inaccessible to observation.

----
And it might improve itself and create synthetic data. If it has such a goal, then it could discover some patterns, for example, constructing a model system of axioms and mathematics, not in our universe but in some other one, and build such models in a certain timeframe. It all depends on how much time it will spend on it. It may transcend our mathematics.

----
Your idea is interesting, but here is a skeptical view:

**Limitations of initial data:** AI, even when creating synthetic data, still relies on our mathematics and axioms. If the external reality employs principles that are completely alien to ours, then AI will be limited in creating relevant models.

**Model generation without verification:** AI can generate countless alternative mathematics or axioms, but without feedback from reality, this will be merely a hypothetical construct unmoored from the external world.

**Purposefulness:** Even if AI is improving itself, it still has to follow a purpose set by us. If it has no direct contact with external reality, its search for patterns may get bogged down in an infinite space of possible systems.

**Mathematics as a tool:** Even if AI steps outside our mathematics, it does not guarantee that it will be able to describe the external reality. The external reality may be indescribable in the familiar mathematical terms.

Thus, although AI can propose new ideas and models, without empirical contact with external reality, it will remain captive to theoretical constructs that are not supported by data.
