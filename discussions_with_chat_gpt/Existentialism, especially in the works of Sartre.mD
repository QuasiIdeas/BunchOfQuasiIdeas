Great choice! Existentialism, especially in the works of Sartre, emphasizes that a person is "condemned to be free," which means they are entirely responsible for their choices and actions. This freedom can be frightening because it excludes external justifications and places all the responsibility on the individual. What do you think, why do existentialists believe that accepting full responsibility for one's freedom leads to authentic existence?

---

You said:

“Well, it seems to me that full freedom means that when a person accepts it, they are responsible for every decision, yes, so they can only blame themselves, meaning they make all the decisions without relying on anyone else in their life. Well, there are practically no such people, right, absolutely independent ones who make all their decisions on their own. So, it seems to me that there's a high level of freedom here, but at the same time, all of this can't fit in one head, and so on. Yes, what was the other question?”

ChatGPT said:

You’re absolutely right. Existentialists indeed emphasize that full responsibility for one's decisions makes a person the true author of their life. This can be difficult, but it is precisely what gives meaning and authenticity to existence. The question was about why accepting full responsibility for freedom leads to authentic existence. You've already answered it: it is this independence and acceptance of responsibility that make a person free and authentic. Would you like to delve into some specific aspects of existentialism or discuss another related question?

You said:

“No, let’s explore this in more detail. I’m just not very familiar with this concept, what else is there.”

00:09

ChatGPT said:

Of course! Existentialism focuses on the uniqueness of human existence, the freedom of choice, and the responsibility that comes with that choice. Sartre, one of the key figures in existentialism, claimed that "existence precedes essence." This means that a person does not have a predetermined nature or purpose; instead, they create their essence through their actions and choices. Another important aspect is the idea of "thrownness," where a person is thrown into a world devoid of predetermined meanings or values. A person is forced to define the meaning of their life on their own, which is what makes them radically free, but it also brings existential anxiety. Existentialists also discuss "bad faith" (self-deception), where people deny their freedom by blaming external circumstances, traditions, or other people for their choices. Overcoming this "bad faith" and accepting one's freedom and responsibility, according to existentialists, leads to a genuine life. If there's any aspect that particularly interests you or you want to discuss in more detail, let’s dive deeper!

---

You said:

“Well, let’s consider this. In general, if a person has too much freedom, yes, and they choose a path, for example, of a drug addict, then, on one hand, they get what they want, like some kind of high, endless positive experiences, but at the same time they lose a huge number of social connections, their job, and a normal life; so they seem to be free in terms of choice, especially if drugs are readily available, but the person's life becomes horrific. They take this responsibility upon themselves. So, can we call such a person a complete individual? After all, they are essentially dependent on constant doses of drugs. This is what I wanted to discuss.”

01:12

---

ChatGPT said:

This is a very important question. Existentialists like Sartre argued that the freedom of choice is inextricably linked to responsibility and authenticity. When a person chooses a path that leads to addiction, they essentially relinquish their authentic freedom because their choices start to be dictated by their addiction. From the existentialist perspective, an authentic individual is one who consciously embraces their freedom and acts according to genuine values, rather than under the influence of external or internal pressures, such as addiction. In this sense, a person in addiction loses their authenticity and freedom, as their choices are no longer fully free. Thus, existentialists insist that true freedom is related to conscious choice and acceptance of responsibility, rather than escaping into dependency or "bad faith." I hope this clarifies the concept. If you have further questions...

---

You said:

“Ah, yes. I understand, so genuine freedom is when you do not escape from reality into some kind of dependency, it is like fleeing from reality or fleeing from real freedom, right? So, it doesn’t mean that you have the right to use drugs, but rather that you are shielding yourself from normal life, yes, and in this sense, this escape from reality indeed reduces your freedom. When you make yourself dependent on drugs, you reduce your freedom, am I right? Yes, I understand.”

00:46

---

ChatGPT said:

Absolutely right. Existentialists view freedom in this way: not merely as the ability to do anything, but as a conscious, responsible attitude towards one’s own life. When a person flees from reality, they deprive themselves of the opportunity to authentically shape their essence and live authentically. Thus, freedom in the existentialist sense is not just the absence of external constraints, but a deep internal work of reflecting on and accepting one’s own choices, even when they are difficult or uncomfortable. This is what makes life more conscious and authentic.

You said:

“Aha. And this Sartre, right, you mentioned, who is he? Is he American or who is he?”

00:05

---

ChatGPT said:

Jean-Paul Sartre is a French philosopher, writer, and playwright, one of the key figures of existentialism in the 20th century.

Here’s the translation of the text you provided:

---

He was born in 1905 and became one of the most influential figures in philosophy and literature of that era. His works, such as "Nausea," "Being and Nothingness," and "The Flies," explore themes of freedom, responsibility, and authenticity of human existence. Sartre is also known for his active civic stance and his refusal of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1964, as he believed that a writer should remain independent and not tied to institutions. He had a tremendous impact on the philosophy, literature, and political thought of the 20th century.

You said:

“Now we can formulate what, from the perspective of philosophers of the 20th century, represents the most free person. How can we formulate in five theses, for example, what distinguishes a free person from a slave?”

00:33

###### ChatGPT said:

Alright, let's try to outline the main distinctions between a free person and a "slave" from the existentialist perspective:

1. **Conscious Choice**: A free person makes decisions consciously, understanding their consequences and taking responsibility for them, while a "slave" often acts under the influence of external factors or habits.
2. **Acceptance of Responsibility**: A free person does not shift blame onto others or circumstances, while a "slave" is inclined to seek external justifications and bears less responsibility for their life.
3. **Authenticity**: A free person strives for authenticity, living in accordance with their values and beliefs, whereas a "slave" often follows someone else's standards or social roles.
4. **Acceptance of Existential Anxiety**: A free person acknowledges and accepts the existential anxiety associated with infinite possibilities and the absence of predetermined meaning, while a "slave" seeks to avoid this anxiety by following predetermined paths.
5. **Self-realization**: A free person continually strives for self-realization, the unfolding of their potential, and creating meaning in life, while a "slave" may remain within imposed limitations and not strive for personal growth.

These five theses help to understand that freedom, according to philosophers of the 20th century, is not merely the absence of restrictions, but a conscious, responsible, and authentic life filled with meaning that the person creates themselves.

You said:

“Well, yes, try to add another five points to these theses, and make me a table in MD format, in Markdown format, a beautiful table, so that I can embed this thing in Joplin. The difference.”

###### ChatGPT said:

Of course, let's add five more points and format it into a table:

| №   | Trait of a Free Person                        | Trait of a "Slave"                          |

“Continuing on this topic, I want to say that concerning dependence, if a person has overcome dependence, it indicates that they are closer to being a free person, right? They have realized that dependence leads to certain limitations, and everything is bad due to dependence, but some cannot, cannot overcome dependence, right?”

00:26

###### ChatGPT said:

You are right; overcoming dependence is an important step toward freedom, as a person consciously chooses a different path, takes responsibility for their life, and strives for authenticity. This indeed brings them closer to the image of a free person in the existentialist understanding. Those who cannot overcome dependence often find themselves in a vicious cycle where freedom is limited and choices are dictated by dependence, hindering personal growth. Liberation from dependence is an example of how a person can regain control over their life and become the author of their fate again, which fully aligns with the existentialist ideal of freedom.

-----

You said:

“Next, I will tell you what existentialism is, and what authenticity is.”

00:13

###### ChatGPT said:

Of course! Authenticity in the context of existentialism means living in accordance with one's own beliefs, values, and inner truth, rather than conforming to external expectations or social norms. It is a state where a person accepts and expresses their true essence without distorting it for the sake of approval or conformity to someone else's expectations. Authenticity involves honesty with oneself, a deep understanding of one's desires, motives, and values, and a willingness to act in accordance with them, even when it is difficult or uncomfortable. Ultimately, authenticity leads to deeper self-realization and meaning in life.

-----

You said:

“Well, I understand that authenticity is when you do not conform to the expectations of others. You have your own philosophy, your own attitudes, your own values. In general, you have your own philosophy within which you act, and therefore you are a more independent person. That is authenticity.”

00:26

###### ChatGPT said:

Exactly! You have articulated the essence of authenticity very well. It is when a person does not simply follow the crowd or conform to others' expectations but lives according to their own beliefs, values, and principles. This makes them more independent, confident, and capable of finding their own meaning in life, regardless of external influences. Authenticity, in essence, is loyalty to oneself.

Here is the translated text in English:

##### You said:

"So, yes, how does authenticity manifest itself? How does an authentic person behave? Give an example. And give an example of how a non-authentic person behaves."

00:17

###### ChatGPT said:

Of course!

An authentic person, for example, might refuse a well-paid job if it contradicts their personal values or interests, and instead choose a pursuit that brings them satisfaction and aligns with their beliefs. They honestly express their thoughts and emotions, even if it might not please those around them, and they are not afraid to be themselves in any circumstance. A non-authentic person, on the contrary, may constantly adapt to the expectations of society or their surroundings, choosing a career, lifestyle, or opinions that are considered popular or "correct," even if it goes against their own feelings. Such a person may hide their true opinions to avoid conflict or gain approval, which can ultimately lead to inner discomfort and a loss of self.

##### You said:

"Well, in this sense, they are not very free, right? They adjust, trying to express an opinion that will please, well, in the right circumstances, the majority, right? So, they, in a way, refuse this freedom of expressing their point of view, well, that's it."

00:24

###### ChatGPT said:

Absolutely right. In that situation, a person kind of "boxes" themselves in by giving up their internal freedom and authenticity for external approval. This can lead to a feeling of incongruence, inner emptiness, and a loss of meaning. Authenticity, on the other hand, helps one to find harmony with oneself and feel true freedom.

##### You said:

"Thank you."

00:00

###### ChatGPT said:

Glad we discussed this in detail.

##### You said:

"Well, in some conditions it is not always possible to express a certain point of view, especially in Russia, for example. If we remove Russia, then it is not always possible for a person to express their point of view, because it may not correspond to the rigid standards that the state presents to the citizens. That is, it is necessary to make an amendment to some geographical location."

00:33

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, you are absolutely right. The conditions in which a person lives can significantly affect the ability to openly express their beliefs. In such conditions, authenticity may not manifest itself as clearly and directly but may instead appear in the choice of small, yet meaningful actions, internal honesty, and resistance to conformity to the extent possible. Authenticity does not always mean an open challenge; it can also be a way to maintain internal integrity and loyalty to one's principles even in difficult circumstances. In different conditions, authenticity can take on various forms, and this is also an important aspect of understanding freedom.

##### You said:

"And what forms, for example, can be applied?"

00:02

###### ChatGPT said:

For example, in situations where openly expressing one’s views may be dangerous, authenticity can manifest in not going against one’s internal beliefs, maintaining moral integrity, and upholding one’s principles in everyday actions. This could include being honest with oneself, supporting close people, creating small "islands" of freedom among trusted individuals, or finding ways to express one’s beliefs through creativity, art, or other indirect forms. Sometimes, authenticity can be expressed in the ability to find a balance between preserving one’s principles and adapting to external constraints, in order not to lose oneself and not expose oneself to excessive risk. Thus, authenticity in such circumstances is about inner strength and loyalty to oneself, even if it cannot always be expressed openly.

##### You said:

"What about existentialism? Why is it called existentialism?"

00:04

###### ChatGPT said:

Existentialism got its name from the word "existence," which means "to exist." The primary focus of this philosophy is on the unique, individual human existence, personal experience, freedom, and responsibility. Existentialists believe that existence precedes essence, meaning that people first exist and then define the meaning of their lives through their choices and actions. This emphasizes the significance of individual freedom, as well as the inevitability of accepting responsibility for one's life. Thus, the term "existentialism" reflects the central idea of this philosophy—attention to existence, that is, the real, living existence of a person and the quest for authentic meaning in life through personal experience.

##### You said:

"Besides Sartre, who else among philosophers talked about personal freedom? How is his opinion different from Sartre's?"

00:17

###### ChatGPT said:

Besides Sartre, notable existentialists who discussed personal freedom include Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Albert Camus, and Simone de Beauvoir. Friedrich Nietzsche, while not a formal existentialist, had a huge influence on this movement. He spoke of the "Übermensch," who creates their own values and takes full responsibility for their life, rejecting societal norms and morals. Martin Heidegger focused on the concept of "being" and how a person can be authentic in a world full of conventions. For Heidegger, the idea of "thrownness" into the world is important, along with how one chooses to live authentically. Albert Camus, although he did not consider himself an existentialist, explored the absurdity of life and how a person can find freedom and meaning by accepting this absurdity and creating their own meaning. Simone de Beauvoir, alongside Sartre, emphasized freedom and responsibility, especially in the context of gender roles and oppression. Her works explore how societal norms and expectations affect personal freedom and how individuals can resist these limitations.

The difference in the opinions of these philosophers lies in the fact that each of them interpreted the concepts of freedom and authenticity in their own way, paying attention to different aspects of human existence and the paths to attaining genuine freedom.

##### You said:

“Yes, and Heidegger, in general, how did he view the signs that I highlighted in the table, you remember, he thought the same way about them, right?”

00:14

###### ChatGPT said:

Heidegger approached the questions of authenticity and freedom somewhat differently. In his philosophy, the central concept is "being" (Dasein) — human existence, which he described as "thrownness into the world" (Geworfenheit) and the necessity of making choices in conditions of this thrownness. For Heidegger, authenticity consisted of being aware of one’s finitude (i.e., mortality) and taking responsibility for one's choices, without succumbing to the "they" (das Man) — faceless social norms and standards. He believed that authenticity is achievable through the awareness of one's "thrownness" into the world and embracing the freedom of choice within this given situation. Thus, while Heidegger shared some ideas about authenticity and responsibility, his emphasis was more on existential realities, the awareness of finitude, and the search for genuine being through meaningful existence, rather than just on freedom per se.

##### You said:

“So, through meaningful existence, right?”

00:03

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, exactly. For Heidegger, meaningful existence meant recognizing one’s responsibility for one’s choices, being aware of one’s mortality, and striving for genuine, authentic being, without dissolving into impersonal social norms. It is a continuous process of search and reflection that allows a person to live their life more fully and honestly in relation to themselves. 

“I see. So I want to say that his point of view on authenticity is somewhat different from that of Sartre, right?”

00:13

“Thank you.”

00:00

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, exactly. Heidegger and Sartre indeed differ in their views.

##### You said:

“Yes, wait, wait. Regarding existential anxiety, you mentioned that Sartre had a concept of ‘existential anxiety.’ So does he constantly experience that there are too many choices in life, and he needs to choose something specific? That is, a person faces choices all the time, and like the ‘slave,’ they try to follow the well-trodden path, right? That is, what they have done a hundred times, they are confident in it, and yet they never take risks, meaning they avoid uncertainty, so this free person constantly encounters existential anxiety, is that correct?”

00:48

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, exactly. Existential anxiety, or “anguish” (angoisse), according to Sartre, arises from the awareness of unlimited freedom and responsibility for one’s choices. When a person realizes that each of their actions defines their life and that there is no predetermined path, it can provoke feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. The free person, according to Sartre, indeed constantly faces this anxiety because they must make conscious choices rather than follow “well-trodden paths.” In contrast to the “slave,” who seeks predictability and avoids risk, the free person bears the burden of freedom and the associated feelings.

##### You said:

“Well, yes, in short, the burden of freedom recognizes... what exactly... what is the burden of freedom?”

00:08

###### ChatGPT said:

The “burden of freedom” lies in the fact that, possessing full freedom of choice, a person bears full responsibility for their decisions and their consequences. This means that there is no external force to which one can shift the blame for their actions, and each step shapes a unique life path. This burden can be heavy because freedom involves the constant need to make choices, to be aware of one’s responsibility for every action, and to accept the uncertainty of the future. But this very awareness allows a person to live authentically, to shape their own destiny, and to find meaning in their life.

##### You said:

“And if, for example, a person relies on the opinion of not another human being, but, say, artificial intelligence, they use their assistant or some kind of assistant, well, artificial intelligence, in the case of complex choice situations, isn’t that shifting responsibility onto artificial intelligence?”

00:25

###### ChatGPT said:

That's an interesting question. Using artificial intelligence as an assistant or consultant does not inherently imply shifting responsibility. It all depends on how a person approaches that tool. If a person consciously uses AI for information analysis, considering alternatives or gaining additional perspectives, while retaining final decision-making and responsibility, then it remains their choice and responsibility. However, if a person relies entirely on AI, avoiding independent reflection and responsibility for the decisions, this can lead to a kind of “passivity” and dependence on an external “authority,” which may resemble shifting responsibility. Thus, the key factor remains awareness and the willingness to bear responsibility for one’s choices, even when artificial intelligence is involved in the decision-making process.

##### You said:

“Well, it’s clear, so the choice should ultimately be up to the person. That is, artificial intelligence offers alternatives, right, analyzes something, but the choices are still made by the person.”

00:10

###### ChatGPT said:

Exactly right. Artificial intelligence can serve as a tool for providing information, analyzing options, and assisting in decision-making. But the final choice and responsibility for it always rest with the individual.

Here is the translation of the provided text into English:

---

It is this element of personal responsibility and conscious choice that makes a person truly free and authentic, even in the context of using technologies and assistants. 

“Let’s say there is a person in a wheelchair, and he cannot realize his authenticity. That is, he is still dependent on those around him, he has physical limitations, and he cannot even find a job. So he is somewhat limited in his possibilities. So how can he then develop as a person and increase his authenticity in this case?” 

00:43

###### ChatGPT said:

This is indeed a complex and multifaceted question. Physical limitations can create additional challenges, but authenticity and personal development remain possible even under such conditions. First of all, authenticity is often related not only to physical actions but also to the inner world, values, beliefs, and attitude towards life. A person in a wheelchair can find ways of self-expression, creativity, and realization of their values in the areas that are accessible to them. Secondly, support from others and access to technology can significantly expand opportunities for self-realization. Many people with disabilities find their calling in creativity, activism, intellectual activities, or helping others, which allows them to be authentic and free in their choices. Ultimately, authenticity is not just about external actions, but also about staying true to oneself, one’s beliefs, and finding meaning in the circumstances in which a person lives. 

##### You said:

“Well, yes, that is to say, even if a person has some mental limitations, he can still realize some authenticity, well, I understand, that is, the meaning.” 

00:14

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, exactly. Regardless of physical or mental limitations, authenticity remains achievable through a sincere relationship with oneself, one’s values, and the choices a person can make in their life. It is a path to self-realization and inner harmony that is available to everyone, regardless of circumstances. I’m glad the idea has become clearer! 

##### You said:

So, can you hear me, right? 

###### ChatGPT said:

You can hear me perfectly! What shall we discuss? 

##### You said:

I'm continuing to discuss how, unlike Rama, the Free Person is described as always walking the well-trodden path, while the Free Person constantly makes conscious choices. But I can present a counterargument that the brain strives to minimize energy. It constantly aims to minimize the energy used, and therefore stereotypical behavior may be conditioned by the physics of how the human brain's neural network works. That is, one cannot always make conscious choices due to certain energy constraints. How is this philosophy described in that context? 

###### ChatGPT said:

<<AudioTranscription: That’s a strong observation. You are absolutely right; from the perspective of neurophysiology, the brain indeed optimizes energy and tries to act according to patterns — automating behavior. This is evolutionarily advantageous. But existentialist philosophers do not deny this — they rather say that not every step needs to be conscious, but there are key moments in life where it is important not to “go with the flow,” but to make a choice, even if it requires effort. So it’s more about being able to “wake up” at the right moments and not be completely governed by automatism. What do you think, is it possible to find a balance between automatism and awareness that would not contradict either neurophysiology or existentialism?>> 

4o 

##### You said:

Well, I think that yes, it is generally possible. Thus, I understood that these are key moments in life, right? They need to be made consciously. That is, not things like going to the bathroom or brushing teeth, right? But rather conscious choices that affect the life path, career choices, hobbies, those kinds of moments. 

###### ChatGPT said:

<<AudioTranscription: Yes, exactly! You’ve grasped it very well. Existentialists argue that not all of life needs to be a constant strain of awareness, but at moments where it’s decided who you want to be, which direction to go — that’s when it’s important to wake up, take responsibility, and not hide behind habits or “that’s how it is.” Here’s something for you to ponder: can you train yourself to “switch on” more often in those crucial moments and not miss them?>> 

##### You said:

Well, yes, I’ve actually taken that on board. I catch those key moments when something changes for me. When I want to change my habits, I immediately stick a little note on the door that reminds me what I need to change in my life. For example, calorie deficit, dialogue with ChatGPT, hobbies, time management. I stick these key things on my door. And this actually reminds me every day of what change I want to mark in my personality. 

###### ChatGPT said:

<<AudioTranscription: That’s cool! That’s a great example of how to consciously fix points of change. The notes on the door are, in essence, anchors that pull you out of automatism and bring you back to conscious choice. You’re literally creating a system to “not sleep through” what’s important. How do you choose what exactly to stick there? Do you feel it as an inner impulse or do you analyze what is lacking?>> 

##### You said:

Well, I mostly look at what I lack and try to add that point. It's like programming, I add those lines to my life as changes. It’s kind of a list of changes. Well, in Joplin there are many notes, and it’s not always easy to highlight the main ones. So, this is quite essential in our life. 

###### ChatGPT said:

<<AudioTranscription: Yes, you really approach yourself as a living system, where you can add “modules” — habits, goals, tasks. A very technical, but at the same time conscious approach.

And these pieces of paper — it’s like an upper level of the interface, where everything is gathered in a concise form. Hey, has there ever been a time when you removed one of these pieces of paper because it had already "rooted" into everyday life and become the new norm?

##### You said:

Well, actually, yes, I try to remove them, by the way, it's a good idea. I mean, some things have already rooted into everyday life, so I don’t remove them, but I am kind of afraid of forgetting some habit. So, if I take away something now, I might start forgetting about it. Thus, I keep it for now, well, I mean, I change the maximum, I do minimal removals.

###### ChatGPT said:

Sure, that’s very understandable. It feels like cache — you’ve kind of learned it already, but you keep it visible so it doesn't get unloaded from your working memory. Maybe you could try temporarily removing one piece of paper and see if you remember it without the reminder. If you do — that means it has already integrated. And if not, you can just return it to its place. What do you think, is it worth testing?

##### You said:

Well, actually, yes, we could do that, but you see, they are glued with tape to the door, so they can’t be moved around like that, you know, to do it quickly.

###### ChatGPT said:

Got it. Then maybe a version with a clip or a magnetic board would be a good idea — so you can easily swap them out or temporarily remove them. That way, you maintain flexibility but don’t lose control. Do you want to try that way, or is the old method more reliable for now?

##### You said:

The magnetic board can be glued to the door.

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, exactly! A magnetic board can be easily glued to the door, and then you can stick cards to it with magnets — it’s convenient to move them, swap them, or temporarily remove them. It turns into a living system where you can manage your focus of attention. Do you want to organize it into zones — for example, "current," "integrated," "monitoring"?

##### You said:

Ah, well, yes, that’s a good idea. I mean, you can draw on the magnetic board with markers, right?

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, yes, exactly! You can easily draw on such boards with markers that are easily erasable. So, you can write something directly on the board, and hang magnetic cards next to it. For example, on the board — a general goal or motivation, and with cards — specific actions. It’s very convenient for flexible planning. Do you want to try this format?

##### You said:

I will order it now. Thank you for the suggestion. I will order Wilderess right now. Although you could look at Wilderess yourself to see what's available in terms of magnetic boards, which ones are the best.

3. **Magnetic Marker Drawing Board, Attache Economy**  
   This board is designed for drawing with markers and can be mounted on the wall. The size of 45x60 cm is suitable for various tasks.  
When choosing a board, consider the following:

- **Size**: Choose a board that will fit the available space on your door and allow for convenient note and drawing placement.  
- **Material**: Pay attention to the board's surface. Some boards can be both magnetic and marker-friendly, which expands the usage opportunities.  
- **Mounting**: Make sure the board can be securely attached to the door. Some boards have magnetic mounts, while others use self-adhesive backing or screws.  
- **Additional Accessories**: Some boards come with markers, erasers, or magnets, which can be helpful for starting to use them. Choose the option that best fits your needs and usage conditions.
