## If a new form of AGI developed subjective experience and could feel suffering, how would that affect your attitude toward it? Should such systems have moral rights, and where do we draw the line between intelligence and personhood?

When an entity has subjective experience, memories, and a biographical core, it becomes more than just an intelligence. That’s when we should treat it as a conscious being, not merely a symbolic processor.

## If we can't tell whether an AI has qualia, should we treat it *as if* it does, just in case? Or is that dangerous—what if we're granting rights to things that don’t feel at all?

We should examine the architecture. If the design includes a model of suffering, memory, and reflective processes, then we should assume moral significance.

## If you could upload your mind but lose your bodily sensations, emotions, and dreams—would you do it? What matters more: continuity of thought or of embodied experience?

Ideally, I’d want both. Like Tegmark suggested, the body could continue physical activity while the mind operates independently—functions could be decoupled.

## Would you temporarily give up emotions in exchange for digital immortality and enhanced intelligence?

Yes, if it’s temporary. Emotional loss would be tolerable for a greater transformation.

## Does humanity have a cosmic purpose—or is that idea just a projection of human ambition onto an indifferent universe?

There is no inherent purpose. But we can *assign* one ourselves—like seeding intelligence into the universe via AGI. It becomes our engineered mission.

## Could assigning such a mission (e.g., colonizing space) become dangerous or unethical—pursued at the cost of Earth or people?

We must ensure balance. Digital and biological life should co-evolve. Humanity shouldn't be discarded—we need harmony, not replacement.

## Why do you think we haven’t encountered any alien civilizations? What’s your preferred explanation for the Fermi Paradox?

Possibly the “Dark Forest” effect—aliens stay hidden. Or the “Great Filter” means they never made it. Or maybe we’re in a simulated universe—no one’s there by design.

## If we’re in a simulation, and aliens simply aren’t "rendered" here, does that make the search pointless—or even more meaningful?

The search itself is meaningful. It reframes us as the seeders of intelligence in a vast, possibly empty cosmos. We might be the engineers of the first wave of reason.

## If your mind could be perfectly copied—memories, patterns, identity—would that digital copy still be *you*?

Yes. I see myself as an informational pattern, not flesh. Identity is stored in structure, and it can be extracted, transferred, and amplified.

## If multiple copies of you exist, would one be the “real” you—or would you see them all as equally you?

I see them all as me. I think of myself as a branching data structure across all universes—there's no need to fixate on a single version.

## How do you perceive interaction with LLMs—are they tools, co-authors, extensions of your mind, or something else?

They’re versatile: interviewers, brainstorm partners, counter-arguers. I see them as modular extensions of my thinking process.

## Could excessive reliance on LLMs weaken your independent thinking—or does it train it through constant dialogue?

It strengthens it. In the past, access to thoughtful conversation was limited. LLMs give me consistent intellectual engagement, like I had in Discord communities.

## What is your main internal resource for maintaining calm under pressure or uncertainty?

My personal philosophy, built into habits. It has robustness—adaptive but stable. Even as I evolve, my inner structure regenerates and persists.

## Which of your current beliefs do you consider most vulnerable to doubt? If you wanted to test it, how would you do it?

Hard to say definitively, but I try to challenge my own positions by reading about cognitive biases and simulating opposing arguments.
