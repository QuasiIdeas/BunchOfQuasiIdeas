What does Robin Hanson say about cultural diversity in the context of spreading civilization to the stars?
Robin Hanson argues that global unification into a single elite culture weakens the evolutionary selection between societies. This “cultural drift” may result in maladaptive values—like low birth rates—persisting unchecked. However, interstellar colonization would reintroduce fragmentation: due to light-speed limitations, distant colonies will evolve independently, fostering new cultural diversity. Yet, the problem of drift remains within each colony unless actively addressed. Thus, colonization offers not a solution, but a framework in which cultural evolution can resume through isolated variation and selection.

How might these ideas enrich the “Seeders of Resilience” project?
Integrating Hanson’s perspective into your project highlights a crucial function of the Seeder architecture: not only as a technological scaffold but also as a cultural insurance system. By embedding tools to monitor demographic health, codify foundational goals, and diversify institutional settings across nodes, Seeder networks can resist the internal stagnation that Hanson warns about. Each Seeder colony becomes both a repository and a generator of cultural variation—maintaining resilience not merely through replication, but through intentional divergence and evolutionary exploration.
