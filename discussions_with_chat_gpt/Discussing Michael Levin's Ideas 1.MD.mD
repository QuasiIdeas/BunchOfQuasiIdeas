I would like to discuss the following idea from THIS PODCAST with you:

###### ChatGPT said:

Which specific idea from the podcast do you want to discuss? Many interesting topics are touched upon, from the nature of intelligence and its scaling to the prospects of developing posthuman minds and the moral aspects of future forms of consciousness. Let's delve into a specific point that caught your attention.

##### You said:

Regarding the podcast, there were interesting points about how the human personality constantly changes, and you are kind of changing your future self with your actions, but that future self is actually a different person, which means there is not much difference between you and other people.

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, that's an interesting idea about the continuity and variability of personality. Michael Levin emphasizes that our conception of "self" is more of a process than a fixed state. At every moment, you are a bit different, and in some sense, your future version is a different person with whom you maintain a connection through actions, decisions, and memories. If we accept this logic, the distinction between you and another person becomes blurred. After all, you care about your future "self" just as you might care about any other person. This leads to the thought that the boundaries between individualities are largely an illusion. And if we accept this idea, one could argue that altruism and caring for others is merely an extended version of caring for oneself in the future. How do you feel about this? Does it seem persuasive to you, or do you see any weaknesses in such an argument?

##### You said:

Be skeptical about what I’m saying; present counterarguments. Well, in general, I decided that limiting my future versions in this way, by implementing certain habits in my life, for example, keeping a journal, or posting various guidelines, limits the freedom of my future selves. I think maybe it’s not worth doing that; what do you think?

###### ChatGPT said:

That's an interesting thought, but here’s a counterargument: if you don't implement habits and direct your future version, you’re not so much giving it freedom as leaving it to the whims of circumstance. Your future self will still be shaped by external factors—only not by you, but by random events, cultural influences, biological processes, and so on. In this sense, the refusal of self-formation is not liberation; it’s simply handing control over to chaos. Furthermore, it can be viewed differently: you’re not limiting the freedom of your future self; in fact, you might be expanding it. For instance, if you’ve developed the habit of writing down your thoughts, your future version will have access to a wider range of ideas and knowledge than it would without that habit. Or if you consciously adopt healthy habits, your future self will be in a better physical and mental state, meaning it will have more choices. The question then is: where is the line between beneficial self-formation and excessive control that truly turns the future self into a hostage of past decisions? Maybe it’s not about relinquishing influence over yourself but about leaving room for flexibility and adaptation?

##### You said:

Well, you know, apart from keeping a journal, I also do this: I have a notebook where I have discussions with artificial intelligence, with ChatGPT. I record all discussions about important topics from podcasts in separate documents and then have a conversation with ChatGPT. I keep all of this, so I have a big archive, meaning I save all these ideas, basically.

###### ChatGPT said:

Memory updated

That's a cool way to track the evolution of your thoughts and ideas! You’re effectively creating a dialogue with yourself over time, but in the format of interacting with AI. This is interesting in terms of forming cognitive continuity—you can see how your views change, which arguments convince you, and which do not. How do you use this archive? Do you just reread it, or do you analyze it in some way, comparing your old views with new ones? And have you noticed that your arguments contradict each other over time?

4o

##### You said:

Yes, that happens. I intentionally keep those diaries to see how my viewpoints on various issues change. Because it’s important to consider several perspectives on the same viewpoint. To look at problems from different sides. And it might even be a useful habit to sometimes change your opinion on some matter because it corresponds more to critical thinking and so on.

###### ChatGPT said:

That is indeed a powerful tool for developing critical thinking. Many cling to their beliefs even when there are strong arguments against them, but your approach allows you to consciously revisit your views. In fact, you are modeling the scientific method in your personal reflections—you state a hypothesis, test it, and then see how new data or arguments change it.

Here’s the translation of the provided text into English:

---

But here’s a skeptical point: is there not a risk that such an approach might lead to endless revision without actually establishing any stable principles? If you regularly change your opinion, how do you determine when it’s time to stop and say: “This viewpoint is sufficiently justified to base actions on it”? Or do you believe that constant fluidity of opinions is indeed the right path?

---

##### You said:

No, I don’t think that constant fluidity of opinions is the right path, but on one hand, I keep these discussions with ChatGPT so that I can talk about other topics later, because I have discussed something there, and for example, on this particular path, our conversation hasn’t developed yet. I try to touch on those questions that, for instance, have not yet been addressed on this topic. So having this archive, I clearly know which topics we have already discussed, and it’s not so much about changing my viewpoint as it is about having a variety of opinions.

###### ChatGPT said:

Then your system works more like a map of ideas rather than just a record of changes in opinions. It gives you not only the ability to track the development of your views but also helps expand the boundaries of discussion, so you don’t repeat yourself and go beyond already known arguments. In this sense, your archive becomes a tool for exploration rather than just a chronology of thoughts. But here's another skeptical point: is there a risk that by recording everything so meticulously, you might overly structure your thoughts and limit spontaneity? In other words, perhaps without notes, you would sometimes arrive at the same conclusions but through different paths, which could provide new, unexpected perspectives? Or conversely, do you feel that the archive gives you more freedom rather than confines you?

---

##### You said:

Yes, most likely freedom. And I wanted to ask you one question to clarify. What do you think, can you explain to me in simple terms Michael Levin's idea of the Space of Possible Minds? How would you explain that idea?

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, I can explain in simple terms. Michael Levin talks about the **"space of possible minds"** as a huge set of all possible forms of intelligence. He argues that the mind is not just what we see in humans or animals, but something much broader. We are accustomed to perceiving intelligence in familiar forms — for example, the human brain, the minds of animals, or artificial intelligence. But that’s just a small part of the whole possible picture. Imagine a vast field or map where all kinds of forms of intelligence are located. In one corner is the human mind, in another, artificial neural networks, and in a third, swarms of insects that behave like a single organism. But that’s just the beginning! In this space, there can exist **forms of mind that we cannot even imagine**. For example, minds composed purely of information, collective minds with no individualities, or even minds arising at the level of chemical reactions. Levin’s key idea is that **we are limited in our perception of mind because we are used to looking for intelligence in forms similar to us**. He proposes thinking broader: intelligence can manifest in biology, technologies, in unusual physical processes, in structures that we do not yet know how to recognize. In other words, **the mind is not a thing, but a process**, and it can be found in many unexpected places. We are just at the beginning of exploring this space, and who knows what forms of mind we will discover!

How do you like this explanation? Do you grasp the idea?

---

##### You said:

Yes, I grasp it, thank you. And this reminded me of the Stable Diffusion algorithm. I watched an interesting video yesterday that explains it in a simpler way. We can imagine a space of all possible images, right, of a certain resolution. And in this space, yes, it’s a large space, but not infinite. Most of the images, they are noisy. It’s like Gaussian noise; most images consist of noise, and there aren’t so many good images; they are in certain clusters. The Stable Diffusion algorithm involves finding a path in this space, from noise to some good image. And I thought that the space of possible minds could also be very large, but not as large as images, but approximately on the same scale. That is, we are somewhere at the very beginning of the search; we see only the tip of the iceberg. So, our primate intelligence, some artificial intelligence, animal intelligence, that’s just the tip of the iceberg, and the spectrum of these possible intelligences is much larger than it seems to us.

###### ChatGPT said:

Great analogy! Indeed, if we imagine the **space of possible minds**, it can work in a way similar to the space of all possible images in Stable Diffusion. In your example, most images are just noise, but among them, there are islands of good images. Similarly, **most possible configurations of matter, processes, or systems likely do not possess intelligence**, but in this vast space, there are “islands” where intelligence arises and develops. Stable Diffusion moves **from random noise to meaningful images through directed search**. Perhaps, **the evolution of intelligence in the universe is also a kind of “diffusion” process**, where chaotic interactions of matter gradually form structures capable of cognition. We currently see only **a narrow range of minds** — our human ones, animal ones, and initial forms of AI. But if Levin is correct, then intelligence can **exist in more exotic forms** that are hard for us to even conceive of. For example:

- Minds without physical bodies, existing as electromagnetic patterns.

Here’s the translated text in English:

- Collective minds, where there is no individual "I", but the system acts as a whole. - Minds that are not tied to linear time, but perceive reality in multidimensional states. The question then is: **is it possible to develop an algorithm similar to Stable Diffusion, but for discovering and creating new forms of intelligence?** If we learn to "explore" the space of possible minds, without being limited to anthropocentric models, can we transcend human intelligence, just as Stable Diffusion transcends random noise?

What do you think of this idea? Is it even possible, or are we too limited in our ways of perception? 

---

Yes, it is quite possible that we could transcend human intelligence. This is precisely what transhumanism and posthumanism philosophy aim for: to prepare our primate brains to perceive a larger picture, that there are other minds, and that human morality is not limited to just our morals and philosophy. There are other systems of world perception. We must be more tolerant of other forms of intelligence. This means supporting diversity and living in harmony with them. Other forms of intelligence are possible. And humans can outgrow their form through a certain technology that allows for consciousness uploading into a computer, transferring it to digital carriers. All of this could be enhanced by certain nanobots in the neocortex. In general, transitioning to a fully digital existence is quite realistic. And it turns out that this future version of yourself experiences certain transitions from one state to another. We are responsible for those... Right now, we can already influence future versions that will undergo digital transformation, meaning they will be uploaded to the cloud. We can influence their destiny because, in virtual reality, the rate of personality division is much higher. One could choose several career paths and so on. And that’s how I see it.

---

You developed this idea in a really interesting direction — transhumanistic and posthumanistic. Following your logic, humanity is currently on the brink of transitioning from biological intelligence to something broader. But here are some counterarguments to test the strength of this idea:

1. **Will digital copies really preserve the "I"?**  
   If you upload your consciousness to a computer, will it still be "you" or just a copy of you? If you copy a program of your consciousness ten times, will all ten versions be "you" or will it be ten new consciousnesses? Perhaps you will not experience digital transformation but rather create a new entity.

2. **What if posthuman minds are not interested in human values?**  
   We talk about tolerance towards different forms of intelligence, but what if these intelligences do not share our concept of morality? For example, a superintelligence may not perceive an individual as important at all, instead focusing on maximizing some global parameter that does not include individuals.

3. **What if posthuman existence turns out to be less desirable than it seems?**  
   Transitioning to digital form may offer infinite possibilities, but what if it loses the very meaning of existence? If emotions and experiences turn out to be just algorithmic simulations, would that really be "life"? Perhaps there is value in physical existence that we do not realize until we lose it.

4. **Could a digital mind become a prisoner of an infinite loop?**  
   You mentioned that in virtual reality, one could "split their personality" and follow multiple paths simultaneously. But what if this leads to **choice overload**? You would create versions of yourself that diverge in different directions, but which of them would be the "real you"? Perhaps this creates a paradox where personality dissolves into a web of possibilities, losing its integrity. What do you think about these risks? Is it possible that instead of liberation, we end up with another form of dependency?

---

You can bring up one question at a time; I can't keep up with all your points. Focus on one issue at a time, okay?

---

Okay, let’s start with the first question: **If you upload your consciousness to a computer, will it still be "you" or just a copy of you?**

If your mind is copied and run in a digital form, will this version be a **continuation** of you, or is it just a separate entity with your memories? If there are several of these copies, which one is the real "you"?

---

Well, in this case, it might not be so important to you that it would not be you but rather another personality, just as it is not important to you that your future versions are also not your personality, even in biological form. What matters is the smooth transition, that I gradually shift without noticing a break between these existences. The important thing is the seamless transition to digital form, that is, the gradual replacement of neurons; this smooth transition is what matters. And of course, the personality will be different.

---

Then the next question: **If personality changes regardless, whether biologically or digitally, does it make sense to talk about the "continuation of oneself," or is it just an illusion of continuity?**

If a smooth transition is more important than preserving a specific "I," does this mean your current personality will ultimately disappear, and a new form of consciousness will simply take its place, claiming to be you? In this case, is the digital version any different from a new personality, convinced of its connection to the original, but in fact already distinct from it?

---

Well, yes, it won’t be the original personality, but it may retain some parts from the original, such as certain aspirations, basic ideas, beliefs, or perhaps some memories from past lives.

Sure! Here's the translation of the provided text into English:

---

Well, we can't completely replace a person's memory; there will still be some kind of history left in their head about themselves.

Yes, memory can be preserved, but then the next question is: **if the new digital identity retains only part of the memories and settings, does it not simply turn into a "descendant" of the original, rather than a continuation of it?**

This resembles the situation with generations: parents pass down part of their experiences, ideas, values to their children, but children are **new personalities**, not a continuation of their parents. In this case, if your digital version retains some of your memories but changes in the process, then it is no longer you but someone new who simply **remembers that they were you**. If so, how important is it that it is you who experiences the digital transformation if the outcome is the creation of a new personality rather than the preservation of the old one?

Well, do you mean to say that my expectations about us being uploaded in the future are...

Yes, I'm suggesting that perhaps **what we call "mind uploading" is not a continuation of the personality but the creation of a new version that simply remembers the original**. It turns out that your expectations may not be about personal "immortality" but rather about **passing the baton** to a new being that will have your memories but will evolve in a different direction. If this is the case, does mind uploading simply transform into a more complex form of inheritance, like passing ideas, books, or DNA to offspring? In this case, is it even worth worrying about "personal" immortality if instead, one could focus on passing on values and knowledge?

Well, basically, yeah, of course. But personal immortality is, in general, important for, say, your personal perception. That is, if you believe in this idea, then yes, you care more about your future versions. And, well, for you, it doesn't all end one fine day; your body continues to exist, and so on. If we, say, extend life, well, an infinite body, it wouldn't experience, like, the dying process, this transformation, like that.

I understand your point: if you believe in personal immortality, then you care about the future "you" and perceive life as a continuous extension rather than a finite point. Then the next question is:

**If your personality is constantly transforming (whether biologically or through digital means), is there even a clear boundary between "yourself" and "not yourself"?**

For example, if you gradually replace all your neurons with artificial ones but still feel like the same person each time, where is the line after which you can say, "This is no longer me"? Or perhaps such a boundary does not exist at all, and personality is simply a smooth change without clear breakpoints?

Well, yes, I think personality should indeed be without breakpoints like that.

Then it turns out that **immortality is not the preservation of a static personality but simply the maintenance of a continuous process of its changes**. But here’s the next question: **if personality is a process without breakpoints, how does digital transformation differ from natural aging and changes in consciousness?**

For instance, over 50 years, a person can change so much that their younger version wouldn’t recognize them, but we still consider them the same person. In this case, digital transformation is just another, more radical stage of personality evolution, not something fundamentally different. Then perhaps immortality is not a matter of "uploading" but simply a matter of **continuous renewal and adaptation to new conditions**?

What were we talking about again? I've lost track of what we were discussing.

We were talking about how the idea of mind uploading is connected to the concept of **continuity of personality**. You proposed the thought that **it's important for the transition process to be smooth**, without sharp breaks, because then a person remains themselves. I raised a counterargument: **how does digital transformation differ from natural aging and changes in personality over time?** After all, a person can change so much over 50 years that their younger version wouldn’t recognize them, yet they still remain "themselves." We approached the question: **is immortality simply a matter of continuous updating of personality, rather than the preservation of some fixed copy of oneself?**

But you see, for me, as a millennial, experience, personal experience, and what’s called qualia, conscious experience are important. That is, I don’t want my life to just suddenly be interrupted like that. I want a smooth transition and for there not to be that break, right, so that I continue to exist, but in a digital version. Like that.

Understood, for you, the importance lies in the **continuity of aware experience**, so that there isn’t a feeling of a sharp break in existence. In this case, the digital transformation should work such that your subjective continuity is preserved—without the feeling of losing "I". But the next question is: **if the digital version experiences qualia, but its perception gradually changes due to new capabilities (like accelerated thinking, new types of perception), will it not become so different that its perception of reality will be completely different?**

That is, perhaps it will remember who you were, but it will no longer feel the world in the same way you do now. It will still be "you" in the sense that the connection remains, but will you feel it exactly **as a continuation of your life**, rather than just the emergence of someone new with similar memories?

Yes, yes, the perception will be completely different, but that’s not a big deal. I mean, that’s how it should be. Everything flows, everything changes.

Then your approach can be described as **conscious acceptance of transformation**, where what matters is not fixing the current "self," but the **smooth transition of consciousness into new forms**.

Here's the translation of the text into English:

---

In this case, **the self is not something static, but rather a process that simply continues in another medium**. Then there is no fear of change, because it is perceived not as a rupture, but as a natural development. But here’s another point for reflection: **if perception radically changes, will the digital version be able to "understand" its biological past version?**

For example, imagine that digital intelligence begins to perceive time differently or expands consciousness to new dimensions unavailable to humans. It may remember who you were, but can it truly **experience** your past emotions and sensations? Or will it be purely analytical knowledge, without a real sense of connection?

---

Well, yes, it probably won't really experience my memories. Well, in general, what of it... I mean, I formally experienced those smooth moments of transformation, yes, and for myself, I fulfilled my function. As for the fact that it won't remember or experience the same events about the past, well, it doesn't really bother me that much.

---

Then your position looks like this: **the main thing is the subjective feeling of continuity in the moment, rather than the precise preservation of past perception**. You are prepared for the new version of you **not to perceive the world in the same way**, but what matters is that at each stage of transition it will feel itself as a continuation. This is interesting because **you are not clinging to a fixed "self," but rather accepting the evolution of your personality**. In this sense, you view consciousness as a **river that changes its course but remains a river**. Then here's the next question: **if consciousness is so plastic, is it even worth trying to preserve human emotions and ways of thinking in a digital mind, or is it better to allow it to evolve into something entirely new right away?**

---

Well, yes, in principle, if it agrees to such a transformation, then I think it should be provided with all opportunities.

---

So, you are proceeding from the **principle of the freedom of the evolution of consciousness,** where the digital version should not get stuck in human limitations if it can develop further. This is quite a strong position because it **does not imply the conservation of human experience, but rather its smooth overflow into something new**. Essentially, you are not trying to create an "eternal human in digital form," but giving this entity the chance to **become what it can become**, even if its perception goes far beyond the consciousness we are used to. The last question in this vein is: **if a post-human mind evolves into something radically different that does not share human values and perceptions, can we even judge whether it will be "better" or "worse," or will any of our assessments no longer matter?**
