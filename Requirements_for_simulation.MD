“Nature shows us only the tail of the lion. But I have no doubt that the lion belongs with it even if he cannot reveal himself all at once. We see him only the way a louse that sits upon him would.”

― Albert Einstein

This work is a continuation of my previous philosophical essay Low resolution simulations for our world. it focussed on consciousness issues. What techniques you can implement to reduce the amount of calculations per digital brain in a simulation like in "The matrix" movie. In this papers i assume that if you reverse engineer the real world technology you can access resources of the outer world from the simulation. just like in the Matrix movie.

In this youtube video i explain how we can optimize simulation of Сonsciousness. I use example of cooking eggs scene where the player cooks eggs in his kitchen and in the middle of that process he receive incoming call on a smartphone from his old friend. She cooking the meal about 20 minutes. In this timeframe player of our hypothetical simulation does not have to use social intelligence, recognize emotions, use some map navigation skills. The only thing that she need to do is very precise motor activity of the muscles. We assume that central nervous system is not simulated int the VR. We simulate only spinal cord impulses and doing rerouting of signals from the so called "real" world using spy nanobots that trace single neuron spikes from the real brain in the real world. The phone call appears at 5 minutes and holds about 15 seconds. This is a call from the pizza delivery guy. In the first 10 seconds before the call "real" brain from "real" world wakes up from an anabiosis state and after that moment we have to do full scale simulation of quantum consciousness or digital consciousness. All the body movements before the call can be done with simple AI movement model in NPC, something like ragdoll.

To test the hypothesis of rerouting signals from the peripheral nervous system you can find evidence of extrasensory phenomena. People that can "feel" the physical pain or other important sensations of other people. I think the help from professional anesthesiology and scientists like Stuart Hameroff can help to dig into the theory of consciousness states and transition from "sleep" state to "awake" state. How can we trick our own sensation using aromatic molecules that is in the modern anesthetics?

Teleportation of state can be done in the hyppocampus using gravity. Hre you can remember scene from the Matrix with endless towers of human slots.

# Requirements for "human slot" in the "real" world
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Ability to transfer memory from cloud to the hippocampus and vise versa
*   First requirement assumes that memory can be transferred not only in space dimensions but also in time dimensions
*   Ability to instantly freeze consciousness state so that after awake human does not notice that he was sleeping
*   Pipe from\\to chemical factory
*   Pipe to canalisation
*   Pipe for nanorobots
*   Pipe for biological liquids like blood with cell lines
*   Magnetic field generators
*   Express chemical testing
*   Interventions food injection
*   Medical and chemical testing equipment
*   Biological viruses detection
*   Biological \\ chemical \\ sound \\ electromagnetic isolation between slots
*   Sanitation of physical liquids
*   Quantum gravity teleportation system for individual brain parts
*   Fridge and liquid nitrogen tank
*   Some system that can physically break or disconnect cable from the nervous system
*   Easy repair of interface cables, traceability of network connections
*   Easy transfer of dead bodies
*   Connection to the cloning factory
*   Ability to use anonymous clones
*   Rerouting nervous signals between several slots
*   Ability to transfer emotions states as an informational pattern from another species with more simple brain like dogs. This is important int the case if you loose links between simulation and the real world or have other communication issues. The system select bright emotional signal, so that clone in the vat dont notice glitches in the matrix.
*   Ability to echoing the real sound signals



# Clone body requirements
---------------------------------------------------
*    Clone body consists of functional equivalent modules in which whole biological protein based elements were replaced by nanotech stuff. Simulating a nanotech enriched body is much easier and requires less cycles per second. When in simulation is it time to watch inside the body let say mri or pet scans evidence can be faked. For example a neuron in the optic nerve, under close examination, contained thousands of molecules like elaborately knotted ropes, running the whole length of the cell body.  At the far end, each polymer was joined to a kind of vesicle, the narrow molecular cable dwarfed by the tiny pouch of cell membrane pinched off from the outside world.  "There are almost three thousand distinct neurotransmitters; they're all proteins, built from three sub-units, with fourteen possibilities for each sub-unit.  
* Neurons were modeled in the greatest detail, and whatever receptors to caffeine and its metabolites had been present on each individual neuron in his original's brain at the time of the scan, his own model-of-a-brain incorporated every one of them -- in a simplified, but functionally equivalent, form.
*   Size of human body between 0.2 to 4x of average humans of 20 century
*   All vital organs can be layouted on a planar structure for better connectivity with computer systems. This can be done with controlled morphogenesis at the growing phase in a clone factory.
*   For example skeleton and skull can be removed
*   All non complex organs can be simplified or removed entire due to cancer risk
*   Heart as a pump of blood can be reduced. Function of biological transport can do nanobots
*   Date of birth in universal galactic time
*   Timestamps of freezing states made in whole lifetime
*   Cloud account there they hold memory stamps for particular subject
*   Subject is not equal to a particular clone.
*   
*   You can find two genetically identical clones with almost identical memory but in simulation they can be a different persons
*   Digestive system can be reduced
*   Identification number inside DNA
*   Identification of clone factory (location in the galaxy, planet, location on the planet)
*   List of clone upgrades made in the growing phase
*   Clone factory can produce normal human body or optimized for the slot body with reduced organs or layouted on the chip via controlled morphogenesis

# Requirements for the simulation
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*   physics of the simulation is not necessary copies the physics of the "real" world
*   quantum physics is simulated using neural network approximated calculation of Schrodinger wave equation
*   classical physics is simulated just like in game engines
*   all complex deterministic calculations of every atom replaced by probabilistic Monte-Carlo methods using top-down approach instead of bottom-up
*   chemical reactions is expensive in terms of computation and reduced the it possible
*   if you need to simulate acid attack on a material you don't need to have all possible acids and know all of they properties. U need to use some abstract model of one acid and you play with time of reaction. In this case simulation use principle of equivalence in simulation of particular function
*   reuse the result of chemical reactions in every standart activity like "cooking eggs"
*   use result of calculations in one world or one time epoch in another world  
*   electromagnetic signal can be done directly without calculating wave propagation
*   space can be calculated as oct tree structure
*   the world is populated mostly by NPC
*   saving world state in the cloud
*   space is calculated only for the players in that locations there is some probability of appearance of the player \* you don't need to simulate all the universe, only one planet!
*   Computational capabilities of a computer varies between Number\_of\_players
*   10^16-10^17 ~ 10^20 operations per second would be enough
*   World support many level of details (LOD) for individual avatar and other virtual objects
*   You don't need to simulate inner objects for example visualization and function of engine cylinder if all you want is to travel from point A to point B in the car
*   Events in the virtual media can be simulated (fake photos in instagram, fake news in newspapers, even fake videos from other branches of one simulation). Generation of fake face using GAN requires orders of magnitude less power than simulating an event with one or several NPC itself.
*   Full scale person simulation is required only for important players. When they get together, it can be hollywood movie, development of rocket, significant science event, invention of something, death of political figure, revolution, fall of the union and so on
*   For simulating voice you don't need to simulate vocal tract of every possible geometry. You use speech synthesis with a neural network that clones some mel spectrogram of a real person. Real vocal tract simulated only one time in one particular world.
*   For simulating guitar sound you don't need to propagate sound waves although it can be done in several cases where it's needed. If it causes something significant, the simulator switches to a more detailed model. Let's look at the rare case of simulating the sound of a guitar with 1 nelon string and 5 metallic strings.
*   Principle of procedure generation based on probability distribution. Like in the story of the man and a dead tree in the forest. If nobody who remembers the dead tree in the forest survives, there is no tree. All you need is to draw default state of reality i.e. default trees most probable types for this location

# Requirements for the NPC
-----------------------------------------------------

*   audio cortex replaced by speech synthesizer, voice cloner network
*   different copies of the same personalities can fork and merge in some moment in the future
*   different layers of simulations like layers of operating system (nested virtual machines)
*   you dont need to think and simulate every neuron in the connectom, thinking processes can be replaced by big language model
*   some people cannot create new thought, they just repeat their old ideas over and over again like a recording
*   in some time brain emulation have more resourses when in other times
*   level of detail principle can be applied to the brain of the sim
*   any new idea is based on previous ideas
*   interface with audio cortex of a real person from the real world
*   convertor from audio signal to neural spikes
*   convertor from neural spikes to audio signal
*   dialog mode 
*   neurons use conducting polymers to carry the signal, instead of membrane action potentials.  The cells themselves are comparable in size to a human's -- but each axon and dendrite carries multiple signals

# Different types of brain emulations
First versions of whole brain emulation was very crude. They were used in surgical operations in VR space. 
For this purpouse you need to emulate only corpus collosum, brain stem, primitive reptile brain capable to maintaining a blood pressure and activate parasympathetic nervous system. It was not a person in literal sense.


# Requirements for ai security systems. Surveillance of the real world
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Find and block hackers that trying to manage things in the real world from the simulation

The memory of some skill situated primary in hippocampus. We can teleport and compress this particular part of the brain. All the rest does not require saving states of every neuron. The immediate state of all neurons in a single moment of time can be compressed. In the "real" world time scale can be very different from the simulation timeline. What seems like continuous experience in a simulation can be separated moments in a real world when real biological brain is sleeping most of the time. When you prepare you meal in the morning time lets say eggs you don't expect to be ready for highly intelligent conversation with Einstein. So you can disable mathematical logic, social intelligence, emotions in your NPC model.

I explain how simulation technology can greatly reduce calculation of a digital brain to imitate realistic behavior.
in this document you can read translated subtitles from this video. Sorry for that not edited transcript. Later i try to write proper more respectful english version.

# In this paper i use the following acronyms
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **AC** stands for "Analog Сonsciousness" (In the real world it can be powerful quantum computer or the real wet brains in a vat) Most expensive module in "real" money per watt \\ flop. Assuming that quantum machines is hardest to maintain as a most complicated devices for simulating reality.
2.  **DC** stands for "Digital Сonsciousness" (This is a classical Turing machine that is simulation biology of the brain neuron by neuron)
3.  **NPC** stands for "Non player character" (AGI or narrow AI that imitate behavior of a biological being)

# Distribution of AC, DC and NPC in a simulation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We live in the world that maybe has 10000 players and all the 8 billion NPC. But in my model we all NPC and a real in the same time. It just depends on time quant of operating system in the outer world. With gravity quantum teleportation you can teleport the state of all neurons from one space time point to another in the real physical world. Maybe with advanced stable diffusion models or GAN you can merge some brain maps from one person to another.

# Требования к энергетической эффективности.
Модель цифрового мозга, которая является копией реального представляется довольно сложной.
Поэтому сложно как-то изменить эту модель, она запускается и поддерживается в монолитном состоянии.
Цифровые нейроны которые иммитируют работу реальных потребляют энергию или в терминах машины Тьюринга 
на их эмуляцию тратятся циклы процессора.
Поэтому скорее всего применяются некие схемы энергоэффективности. 
Т.е. нейроны или сети биологических нейронов которые не используются переводятся в замороженное состояние.
Нам нужно сохранить количество молекул нейротрансмиттеров и потенциал мембраны для каждого "замороженного" нейрона.
Это похоже на замороженные процессоры в андройд ОС.
Если человек не вспоминает в данный момент какие-то события прошлого, то его гиппокам может работать не на 100%, а всего лишь на 20%
Также если человек не переживает какие либо сильные эмоции, как например при катании на американских горках 
его лимбическая система также будет симулирована лишь до определенной степени.
Если конечно в будущем не будет создана некая универсальная цифровая кора где каждый нейрон представляет собой взаимозаменяемую единицу.
В любом слуае эту лишь вопрос количества памяти которое расходуется на сохранения состояния биологической клетки. 
Здесь можно обратиться к схемам управления производительностью в смартфонах. Если у вас не запущена какая либо игра, вы не используете экран и у вас малый заряд аккумулятора, то яркость экрана будет автоматически отрегулирована на минимальную, физические ядра процессоров могут быть заглушены. Важный вопрос также в количестве оперативной памяти которая отводится под модель мозга.
Ведь нам надо сохранить немного не мало а состояние 100 миллиардов нейронов, в каждом синапсе до миллиона молекул нейротранситтера.
Возможно там применяются некие усреднения и методы монте карло для расчетов т.е. хранится только масса или обьем вещества.
Как только мозг перешел в активное состояние начинает расти энергопотребление, тепловыделение повышается, скорость вентиляторов в системе охлаждения растет. Долгое время работы в таком режиме может приводить к перегреву процессора или даже выходу его из строя.
В симулированном мире это может приводить к сенсорной усталости или в состоянии сонливости.

# Данные которые сохранились после сингулярности.
Представим что вы живете в промежутке между 2000 и 2030.
Вы проживаете свою жизни в разных исторических ветках. Какая то ваша копия умерла от сталкновения с авто.
Какая-то копия скончалась в авиакатастрофе, какая-то погибла на войне, в результате самоубийства и т.д.
В итоге до сингулярности доживает одна или несколько ваших копий. Их этой копии создают полный цифровой аналог и запускаяют внутри исторической симуляции наподобии той что показана в фильме Аниматрица. Он продолжает жить но уже внутри симуляции где фактический год снова 2000.
Для того чтобы создать такую симуляцию вам необходимо собрать как можно больше сведений о человеке.
Какие-то ваши самые старые вещи могут быть созданы на основе реальных сканов реальных вещей, но большинство новых вещей скорее всего симулировано созданно мгновенно как новая модель машины в игровом движке GTA 5.
Все его фотографии, 3д можель здания в котором он жил, видео записи родственников. Его профессиональные достижения, например его тексты в интернете или программы если он был программистом. Часть информации хранится в синапсах его мозга и периодичски может восстанавливатся благодаря такому свойству мозга как нейропластичность. Т.е. допустим если вы показываете человеу шоу которое он смотрел 20 лет назад, то на слудующий день он сможет вспомнить называние программы которой он пользовался 20 лет назад или какую-нибудь мелодию из дества.
Так работает биологическая память. Соответсвенно цирфовая модель будет веси себя аналогичным образом.
Более того для более точного восстановления памяти и оригинальныз ощущений вам нужно подделать также каки-то специфические ощущения например если у человека были бреккеты или повышенная кислотность желудка, синдром сухого глаза, может быть аллергия, приступы астмы.
Если цель симуляции - просто посмотреть что получится в истории если все пойдет немного другим путем, то все это может иметь смысл.
Доведет ли эта конкретная конфигурация до создания AGI или все закончится раньше.

# Data that was preserved after the singularity.
Let's imagine that you live between 2000 and 2030.
You live your life in different historical branches. Some copy of you died from a collision with a car.
Some copy died in a plane crash, some died in the war, as a result of suicide, etc.
As a result, one or more copies of you survive to the singularity. A complete digital analogue of this copy is created and launched inside a historical simulation similar to the one shown in the film Animatrix. He continues to live but inside a simulation where the actual year is again 2000.
In order to create such a simulation, you need to collect as much information as possible about the person. Some of your oldest items may be created based on real scans of real items, but most new items are likely simulated to be created instantly like a new car model in the GTA 5 game engine.
All his photographs, 3D models of the building in which he lived, video recordings of relatives. His professional achievements, for example his texts on the Internet or programs if he was a programmer. Some of the information is stored in the synapses of his brain and can be periodically restored due to such a property of the brain as neuroplasticity. Those. Let's say if you show a person a show that he watched 20 years ago, then the next day he will be able to remember the name of the program that he used 20 years ago or some melody from his childhood.
This is how biological memory works. Accordingly, the digital model will weigh in a similar way.
Moreover, for a more accurate restoration of memory and original sensations, you also need to fake some specific sensations, for example, if a person had braces or high acidity of the stomach, dry eye syndrome, maybe allergies, asthma attacks.
If the purpose of the simulation is simply to see what happens in history if things go a slightly different way, then this might all make sense.
Will this particular configuration lead to the creation of AGI or will it all end first.

# Energy efficiency requirements.
The digital brain model, which is a copy of the real one, seems quite complex.
Therefore, it is difficult to somehow change this model; it is launched and maintained in a monolithic state.
Digital neurons that imitate the operation of real ones consume energy, or in terms of a Turing machine
emulating them takes CPU cycles.
```
Multi-Core Processing: Modern smartphone chips utilize multiple cores (including energy-efficient cores for basic tasks 
and high-performance cores for demanding tasks), which allows for workload distribution. 
This design enables SoCs to provide necessary performance without maxing out every core, reducing energy use.
Dynamic Frequency Scaling: This widely used technique allows the processor to adjust its frequency based on demand. 
When full processing power isn't required, the chips run at lower frequencies, and when more processing power is needed, 
the frequency increases.
Dark Silicon: The concept of Dark Silicon emerged as semiconductor manufacturing technology continued to scale down in size. 
While smaller processes allow for more transistors to be placed on a chip, improving its potential performance, 
they also increase power density, which can cause overheating if all transistors were active at the same time. 
To prevent this overheating, not all of the transistors are used at once, resulting in Dark Silicon.
There are design strategies that try to leverage Dark Silicon effectively. 
One prominent approach is "dark silicon aware" design such as heterogeneous computing, 
which proposes using different types of cores within the same processor. 
High-performance cores can handle demanding tasks but consume more power and are used sparingly, 
while power-efficient cores manage everyday tasks and conserve energy.
```
Therefore, some kind of energy efficiency schemes are most likely used.
Those. those neurons or networks of biological neurons that are not used are transferred to a frozen state.
We need to preserve the number of neurotransmitter molecules and membrane potential for each "frozen" neuron.
This is similar to frozen processors in the Android OS.
If a person does not remember at the moment some events of the past, then his hippocam may not work at 100%, but only at 20%.
Also, if a person does not experience any strong emotions, such as when riding a roller coaster
his limbic system will also be simulated only to a certain extent.
Unless, of course, in the future some kind of universal digital cortex is created where each neuron is an interchangeable unit.
In any case, this is just a question of the amount of memory that is spent on maintaining the state of the biological cell.
Here you can refer to performance management schemes in smartphones. If you are not running any game, you are not using the screen and your battery is low, the screen brightness will be automatically adjusted to minimum, and the physical processor cores may be muted. An important question is also the amount of RAM that is allocated to the brain model.
After all, we need to preserve a little, not a little, but the state of 100 billion neurons, in each synapse up to a million neurotransmitter molecules.
Perhaps they use some averaging and Monte Carlo methods for calculations, i.e. Only the mass or volume of a substance is stored.
As soon as the brain enters an active state, energy consumption begins to increase, heat dissipation increases, and the speed of the fans in the cooling system increases. Operating for a long time in this mode can lead to overheating of the processor or even failure.
In a simulated world, this can lead to sensory fatigue or drowsiness.

TODO. \[Insert drawing of some scheme here\]
